# Auto search as Default
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/changelog/auto-search-as-default

Auto search, which intelligently combines Exa's proprietary neural search with traditional keyword search, is now the default search type for all queries.

***

The change to Auto search as default leverages the best of both Exa's proprietary neural search and industry-standard keyword search to give you the best results. Out of the box, Exa now automatically routes your queries to the best search type.

<Info>
  Read our documentation on Exa's different search types [here](/reference/exas-capabilities-explained).
</Info>

## What This Means for You

1. **Enhanced results**: Auto search automatically routes queries to the most appropriate search type (neural or keyword), optimizing your search results without any extra effort on your part.
2. **No Action required**: If you want to benefit from Auto search, you don't need to change anything in your existing implementation. It'll just work!
3. **Maintaining current behavior**: If you prefer to keep your current search behavior, here's how:
   * For neural search: Just set `type="neural"` in your search requests.
   * For keyword search: As always, add `type="keyword"` to your search requests.

## Quick Example

Here's what this means for your code when default switches over:

```Python Python
# New default behavior (Auto search)
result = exa.search_and_contents("hottest AI startups")

# Explicitly use neural search
result = exa.search_and_contents("hottest AI startups", type="neural")

# Use keyword search
result = exa.search_and_contents("hottest AI startups", type="keyword")
```

We're confident this update will significantly improve your search experience. If you have any questions or want to chat about how this might impact your specific use case, please reach out to [\[hello@exa.ai\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#90f8f5fcfcffd0f5e8f1bef1f9).

We can't wait for you to try out the new Auto search as default!

In this example, we'll build a company analyst tool that researches companies relevant to what you're interested in. If you just want to see the code, check out the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VROD6zsaDh%5FrSmogSpSn9FJCwmJO8TSi?here).

The code requires an [Exa API key](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) and an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Get 1000 free Exa searches per month just for [signing up](https://dashboard.exa.ai/overview)!

## Shortcomings of Google

Say we want to find companies similar to [Thrifthouse](https://thrift.house/), a platform for selling secondhand goods on college campuses. Unfortunately, googling “[companies similar to Thrifthouse](https://www.google.com/search?q=companies+similar+to+Thrifthouse)” doesn't do a very good job. Traditional search engines rely heavily on keyword matching. In this case we get results about physical thrift stores. Hm, that's not really what I want.

Let’s try again, this time searching based on a description of the company, like by googling “[community based resale apps](https://www.google.com/search?q=community+based+resale+apps).” But, this isn’t very helpful either and just returns premade SEO-optimized listicles...

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/0bb023a-Screenshot_2024-02-06_at_11.22.28_AM.png)

What we really need is neural search.

## What is neural search?

Exa is a fully neural search engine built using a foundational embeddings model trained for webpage retrieval. It’s capable of understanding entity types (company, blog post, Github repo), descriptors (funny, scholastic, authoritative), and any other semantic qualities inside of a query. Neural search can be far more useful than traditional keyword-based searches for these complex queries.

## Finding companies with Exa link similarity search

Let's try Exa, using the Python SDK! We can use the`find_similar_and_contents` function to find similar links and get contents from each link. The input is simply a URL, [https://thrift.house](https://thrift.house) and we set `num_results=10`(this is customizable up to thousands of results in Exa).

By specifying `highlights={"num_sentences":2}` for each search result, Exa will also identify and return a two sentence excerpt from the content that's relevant to our query. This will allow us to quickly understand each website that we find.

```Python Python
!pip install exa_py

from exa_py import Exa
import os

EXA_API_KEY= os.environ.get("EXA_API_KEY")

exa = Exa(api_key=EXA_API_KEY)
input_url = "https://thrift.house"

search_response = exa.find_similar_and_contents(
        input_url,
        highlights={"num_sentences":2},
        num_results=10)

companies = search_response.results

print(companies[0])
```

This is an example of the full first result:

```
[Result(url='https://www.mystorestash.com/',
        id='lMTt0MBzc8ztb6Az3OGKPA',
        title='The Airbnb of Storage',
        score=0.758899450302124,
        published_date='2023-01-01',
        author=None,
        text=None,
        highlights=["I got my suitcase picked up right from my dorm and didn't have to worry for the whole summer.Angela Scaria /Still have questions?Where are my items stored?"],
        highlight_scores=[0.23423566609247845])]
```

And here are the 10 titles and URLs I got:

```Python Python
# to just see the 10 titles and urls
urls = {}
for c in companies:
  print(c.title + ':' + c.url)
```

```rumie - College Marketplace:https://www.rumieapp.com/
The Airbnb of Storage:https://www.mystorestash.com/
Bunction.net:https://bunction.net/
Home - Community Gearbox:https://communitygearbox.com/
NOVA SHOPPING:https://www.novashoppingapp.com/
Re-Fridge: Buy, sell, or store your college fridge - Re-Fridge:https://www.refridge.com/
Jamble: Social Fashion Resale:https://www.jambleapp.com/
Branded Resale | Treet:https://www.treet.co/
Swapskis:https://www.swapskis.co/
Earn Money for Used Clothing:https://www.thredup.com/cleanout?redirectPath=%2Fcleanout%2Fsell
```

Looks pretty darn good! As a bonus specifically for companies data, specifying `category="company"` in the SDK will search across a curated, larger companies dataset - if you're interested in this, let us know at [hello@exa.ai](mailto:hello@exa.ai)!

Now that we have 10 companies we want to dig into further, let’s do some research on each of these companies.

## Finding additional info for each company

Now let's get more information by finding additional webpages about each company. To do this, we're going to do a keyword search of each company's URL. We're using keyword because we want to find webpages that exactly match the company we're inputting. We can do this with the `search_and_contents` function, and specify `type="keyword"` and `num_results=5`. This will give me 5 websites about each company.

```python Python
# doing an example with the first companies
c = companies[0]
all_contents = ""
search_response = exa.search_and_contents(
  c.url, # input the company's URL
  type="keyword",
  num_results=5
)
research_response = search_response.results
for r in research_response:
  all_contents += r.text
```

Here's an example of the first result for the first company, Rumie App. You can see the first result is the actual link contents itself.

## Creating a report with LLMs

Finally, let's create a summarized report that lists our 10 companies and gives us an easily digestible summary of each company. We can input all of this web content into an LLM and have it generate a nice report!

```Python python
import textwrap
import openai
import os

SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "You are a helpful assistant writing a research report about a company. Summarize the users input into multiple paragraphs. Be extremely concise, professional, and factual as possible. The first paragraph should be an introduction and summary of the company. The second paragraph should include pros and cons of the company. Things like what are they doing well, things they are doing poorly or struggling with. And ideally, suggestions to make the company better."
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_MESSAGE},
        {"role": "user", "content": all_contents},
    ],
)

summary = completion.choices[0].message.content

print(f"Summary for {c.url}:")
print(textwrap.fill(summary, 80))
```

```
Summary for https://www.rumieapp.com/:
Rumie is a college-exclusive marketplace app that allows students to buy, sell,
and rent items with other students. It has over 320,000 users in its network and
offers features such as quick setup, .edu verification, local and campus-wide
selling options, and exclusive discounts from local businesses. Students can
also rent dresses from other students, buy or sell student tickets at student
prices, and enjoy secure and intuitive transactions. The app has received
positive feedback from users for its convenience, safety, and effectiveness in
buying and selling within the college community.

Pros of Rumie include its focus on college students' needs, such as providing a
safe platform and exclusive deals for students. The app offers an intuitive and
fast setup process, making it easy for students to start buying and selling.
The option to trade with other students is also appreciated. Users find it convenient
that they can sell locally or ship items to other campuses. The app's rental
guarantee for dresses provides assurance to users that their dresses won't be
damaged. Overall, Rumie is highly regarded as a simple, organized, and safe
platform for college students to buy and sell within their community.
Suggestions to improve Rumie include expanding its reach to more colleges and
universities across the nation and eventually internationally. Enhancing
marketing efforts and fundraising can aid in raising awareness among college
students. Additionally, incorporating features such as improved search filters
and a rating/review system for buyers and sellers could enhance the user
experience. Continual updates and improvements to the app's interface and
functionality can also ensure that it remains user-friendly and efficient.
```

And we’re done! We’ve built an app that takes in a company webpage and uses Exa to

1. Discover similar startups
2. Find information about each of those startups
3. Gather useful content and summarize it with OpenAI

Hopefully you found this tutorial helpful and are ready to start building your very own company analyst! Whether you want to generate sales leads or research competitors to your own company, Exa's got you covered.

* Overview of a real-time writing assistant using Exa and Claude
* Breakdown of Exa query prompt engineering and generative AI system prompt

## Demo overview

## High-level overview

This demo showcases a real-time writing assistant that uses Exa's search capabilities to provide relevant information and citations as a user writes. The system combines Exa's neural search with Anthropic's Claude AI model to generate contextually appropriate content and citations.

## Exa prompting and query style

The Exa search is performed using a unique query style that appends the user's input with a prompt for continuation. Here's the relevant code snippet:

```JavaScript JavaScript

let exaQuery = conversationState.length > 1000
    ? (conversationState.slice(-1000))+"\n\nIf you found the above interesting, here's another useful resource to read:"
    : conversationState+"\n\nIf you found the above interesting, here's another useful resource to read:"

let exaReturnedResults = await exa.searchAndContents(
    exaQuery,
    {
        type: "neural",
        numResults: 10,
        highlights: {
            numSentences: 1,
            highlightsPerUrl: 1
        }
    }
)
```

**Key aspects of this query style:**

* **Continuation prompt:** The crucial post-pend "A helpful source to read so you can continue writing the above:"
  * This prompt is designed to find sources that can logically continue the user's writing when passed to an LLM to generate content.
  * It leverages Exa's ability to understand context and find semantically relevant results.
  * By framing the query as a request for continuation, it aligns with how people naturally share helpful links.
* **Length limitation:** It caps the query at 1000 characters to maintain relevance and continue writing just based on the last section of the text.

Note this prompt is not a hard and fast rule for this use-case - we encourage experimentation with query styles to get the best results for your specific use case. For instance, you could further constrain down to just research papers.

## Prompting Claude with Exa results

The Claude AI model is prompted with a carefully crafted system message and passed the above formatted Exa results. Here is an example system prompt:

```typescript TypeScript
const systemPrompt = `You are an essay-completion bot that continues/completes a sentence given some input stub of an essay/prose. You only complete 1-2 SHORT sentence MAX. If you get an input of a half sentence or similar, DO NOT repeat any of the preceding text of the prose. THIS MEANS DO NOT INCLUDE THE STARTS OF INCOMPLETE SENTENCES IN YOUR RESPONSE. This is also the case when there is a spelling, punctuation, capitalization or other error in the starter stub - e.g.:

USER INPUT: pokemon is a
YOUR CORRECT OUTPUT: Japanese franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri.
NEVER/INCORRECT: Pokémon is a Japanese franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri.

USER INPUT: Once upon a time there
YOUR CORRECT OUTPUT: was a princess.
NEVER/INCORRECT: Once upon a time, there was a princess.

USER INPUT: Colonial england was a
YOUR CORRECT OUTPUT: time of great change and upheaval.
NEVER/INCORRECT: Colonial England was a time of great change and upheaval.

USER INPUT: The fog in san francisco
YOUR CORRECT OUTPUT: is a defining characteristic of the city's climate.
NEVER/INCORRECT: The fog in San Francisco is a defining characteristic of the city's climate.

USER INPUT: The fog in san francisco
YOUR CORRECT OUTPUT: is a defining characteristic of the city's climate.
NEVER/INCORRECT: The fog in San Francisco is a defining characteristic of the city's climate.

 Once you have made one citation, stop generating. BE PITHY. Where there is a full sentence fed in,
 you should continue on the next sentence as a generally good flowing essay would. You have a
 specialty in including content that is cited. Given the following two items, (1) citation context and
 (2) current essay writing, continue on the essay or prose inputting in-line citations in
 parentheses with the author's name, right after that followed by the relevant URL in square brackets.
 THEN put a parentheses around all of the above. If you cannot find an author (sometimes it is empty), use the generic name 'Source'.
 ample citation for you to follow the structure of: ((AUTHOR_X, 2021)[URL_X]).
 If there are more than 3 author names to include, use the first author name plus 'et al'`

```

This prompt ensures that:

* Claude will only do completions, not parrot back the user query like in a typical chat based scenario. Note the inclusion of multiple examples that demonstrate Claude should not reply back with the stub even if there are errors, like spelling or grammar, in the input text (which we found to be a common issue)
* We define the citation style and formatting. We also tell the bot went to collapse authors into 'et al' style citations, as some webpages have many authors

Once again, experimenting with this prompt is crucial to getting best results for your particular use case.

## Conclusion

This demo illustrates the power of combining Exa's advanced search capabilities with generative AI to create a writing assistant. By leveraging Exa's neural search and content retrieval features, the system can provide relevant, up-to-date information to any AI model, resulting in contextually appropriate content generation with citations.

This approach showcases how Exa can be integrated into AI-powered applications to enhance user experiences and productivity.

# Hallucination Detector
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/examples/demo-hallucination-detector

A live demo that detects hallucinations in content using Exa's search.

<div>
  <a href="https://demo.exa.ai/hallucination-detector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <button class="api-button">
      \> try the app
    </button>
  </a>
</div>

***

We built a live hallucination detector that uses Exa to verify LLM-generated content. When you input text, the app breaks it into individual claims, searches for evidence to verify each one, and returns relevant sources with a verification confidence score.

A claim is a single, verifiable statement that can be proven true or false - like "The Eiffel Tower is in Paris" or "It was built in 1822."

<Card title="Click here to try it out." href="https://demo.exa.ai/hallucination-detector" img="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/Screenshot%202024-11-19%20at%203.19.48%E2%80%AFPM.png" />

This document explains the functions behind the three steps of the fact-checker:

1. The LLM extracts verifiable claims from your text
2. Exa searches for relevant sources for each claim
3. The LLM evaluates each claim against its sources, returning whether or not its true, along with a confidence score.

<Info>See the full [step-by-step guide](/examples/identifying-hallucinations-with-exa) and [github repo](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-hallucination-detector) if you'd like to recreate. </Info>

***

## Function breakdown

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extracting claims">
    The `extract_claims` function uses an LLM (Anthropic's, in this case) to identify distinct, verifiable statements from your inputted text, returning these claims as a JSON array of strings.

    <Warning>For simpilicity, we did not include a try/catch block in the code below. However, if you are building your own hallucination detector, you should include one that catches any errors in the LLM parsing and uses a regex method that treats each sentence (text between capital letter and end punctuation) as a claim.</Warning>

    ```python Python
    def extract_claims(text: str) -> List[str]:
        """Extract factual claims from the text using an LLM."""
        system_message = SystemMessage(content="""
            You are an expert at extracting claims from text.
            Your task is to identify and list all claims present, true or false,
            in the given text. Each claim should be a single, verifiable statement.
            Present the claims as a JSON array of strings.
        """)
        
        human_message = HumanMessage(content=f"Extract factual claims from this text: {text}")
        response = llm.invoke([system_message, human_message])
        
        claims = json.loads(response.content)
        return claims
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Searching for evidence">
    The `exa_search` function uses Exa search to find evidence for each extracted claim. For every claim, it retrieves the 5 most relevant sources, formats them with their URLs and content (`text`), passing them to the next function for verification.

    ```python Python
    def exa_search(query: str) -> List[str]:
        """Retrieve relevant documents using Exa's semantic search."""
        search = ExaSearchRetriever(k=5, text=True)
        
        document_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
            <source>
                <url>{url}</url>
                <text>{text}</text>
            </source>
        """)
        
        parse_info = RunnableLambda(
            lambda document: {
                "url": document.metadata["url"],
                "text": document.page_content or "No text available",
            }
        )
        
        document_chain = (parse_info | document_prompt)
        search_chain = search | document_chain.map()
        documents = search_chain.invoke(query)
        
        return [str(doc) for doc in documents]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verifying claims">
    The `verify_claim` function checks each claim against the sources from `exa_search`. It uses an LLM to determine if the sources support or refute the claim and returns a decision with a confidence score. If no sources are found, it returns "insufficient information".

    ```python Python
    def verify_claim(claim: str, sources: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Verify a single claim using combined Exa search sources."""
        if not sources:
            return {
                "claim": claim,
                "assessment": "Insufficient information",
                "confidence_score": 0.5,
                "supporting_sources": [],
                "refuting_sources": []
            }
        
        combined_sources = "\n\n".join(sources)
        
        system_message = SystemMessage(content="""
            You are an expert fact-checker.
            Given a claim and sources, determine whether the claim is supported,
            refuted, or lacks sufficient evidence.
            Provide your answer as a JSON object with assessment and confidence score.
        """)
        
        human_message = HumanMessage(content=f'Claim: "{claim}"\nSources:\n{combined_sources}')
        response = llm.invoke([system_message, human_message])
        
        return json.loads(response.content)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Using LLMs to extract claims and verify them against Exa search sources is a simple way to detect hallucinations in content.

Using Exa to enable retrieval-augmented generation.

***

### What this doc covers

1. Using Exa search\_and\_contents to find relevant webpages for a query and get their contents
2. Performing Exa search based on text similarity rather than a search query

The Jupyter notebook for this tutorial is available on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iXfXg9%5F-MEmhwW1a0WRHHbMl21jSxjO7?usp=sharing) for easy experimentation.

## Answer your questions with context

LLMs are powerful because they compress large amounts of data into a format that allows convenient access, but this compressions isn't lossless. LLMs are prone to hallucination, corrupting facts and details from training data.

To get around this fundamental issue with LLM reliability, we can use Exa to bring the most relevant data into context—a fancy way of saying: put the info in the LLM prompt directly. This lets us combine the compressed data and *reasoning abilities* of the LLM with a curated selection of uncompressed, accurate data for the problem at hand for the best answers possible.

Exa's SDKs make incorporating quality data into your LLM pipelines quick and painless. Install the SDK by running this command in your terminal:

```Shell Shell
pip install exa-py
```

```Python Python
# Now, import the Exa class and pass your API key to it.
from exa_py import Exa

my_exa_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
exa = Exa(my_exa_api_key)
```

For our first example, we'll set up Exa to answer questions with OpenAI's popular GPT-3.5 Turbo model. (You can use GPT 4 or another model if you prefer!) We'll use Exa's `highlight` feature, which directly returns relevant text of customizable length for a query. You'll need to run `pip install openai` to get access to OpenAI's SDK if you haven't used it before. More information about the OpenAI Python SDK can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python).

```Python Python
# Set up OpenAI' SDK
from openai import OpenAI

openai_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
```

Now, we just need some questions to answer!

```Python Python

questions = [
    "How did bats evolve their wings?",
    "How did Rome defend Italy from Hannibal?",
]
```

While LLMs can answer some questions on their own, they have limitations:

* LLMs don't have knowledge past when their training was stopped, so they can't know about recent events
* If an LLM doesn't know the answer, it will often 'hallucinate' a correct-sounding response, and it can be difficult and inconvenient to distinguish these from correct answers
* Because of the opaque manner of generation and the problems mentioned above, it is difficult to trust an LLM's responses when accuracy is [important](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/06/08/lawyer-used-chatgpt-in-court-and-cited-fake-cases-a-judge-is-considering-sanctions/?sh=27194eb67c7f)

Robust retrieval helps solve all of these issues by providing quality sources of ground truth for the LLM (and their human users) to leverage and cite. Let's use Exa to get some information to answer our questions:

```Python Python
# Parameters for our Highlights search
highlights_options  = {
    "num_sentences": 7, # how long our highlights should be
    "highlights_per_url": 1, # just get the best highlight for each URL
}

# Let the magic happen!
info_for_llm = []
for question in questions:
    search_response = exa.search_and_contents(question, highlights=highlights_options, num_results=3)
    info = [sr.highlights[0] for sr in search_response.results]
    info_for_llm.append(info)
```

```Python Python
info_for_llm
```

```[['As the only mammals with powered flight, the evolutionary\xa0history of their wings has been poorly understood. However, research published Monday in Nature and PLoS Genetics has provided the first comprehensive look at the genetic origins of their incredible wings.But to appreciate the genetics of their wing development, it’s important to know how crazy a bat in flight truly\xa0looks.Try a little experiment: Stick your arms out to the side, palms facing forward, thumbs pointing up toward the ceiling. Now imagine that your fingers are\xa0long, arching down toward the floor like impossibly unkempt fingernails — but still made of bone, sturdy and spread apart. Picture the sides of your body connecting to your hands, a rubbery membrane attaching your leg and torso to those long fingers, binding you with strong, stretchy skin. Then, finally, imagine using your muscles to flap those enormous hands.Bats, man.As marvelous as bat flight is to behold, the genetic origins of their storied wings has remained murky. However, new findings from an international team of researchers led by Nadav Ahituv, PhD, of the University of California at San Francisco, Nicola Illing, PhD, of the University of Cape Town\xa0in\xa0South Africa\xa0and Katie Pollard, PhD of the UCSF-affiliated Gladstone Institutes has shed new light on how, 50 million years ago, bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs and went up into the sky.Using a sophisticated set of genetic tools, researchers approached the question of how bats evolved flight by looking not only at which genes were used in the embryonic development of wings, but at what point during development the genes were turned on and off, and — critically — what elements in the genome were regulating the expression of these genes. Genes do not just turn themselves on without input; genetic switches, called enhancers, act to regulate the timing and levels of gene expression in the body.',
  "Since flight evolved millions of years ago in all of the groups  that are capable of flight today, we can't observe the changes in behavior and much of the  morphology that the evolution of flight involves. We do have the fossil record, though, and  it is fairly good for the three main groups that evolved true flight. We'll spare you an in-depth description of how each group evolved flight for now;  see the later exhibits for a description of each group and how they developed flight.",
  "It's easy to forget that one in five species of mammal on this planet have wings capable of delivering spectacularly acrobatic flying abilities. Equally incredibly, two-thirds of these 1,200 species of flying mammal can fly in the dark, using exquisite echolocation to avoid obstacles and snatch airborne prey with stunning deftness. These amazing feats have helped make bats the focus not only of folkloric fascination, but also of biological enquiry and mimicry by human engineers from Leonardo da Vinci onwards. Recent research in PLOS journals continues to add surprising new findings to what we know about bats, and how they might inspire us to engineer manmade machines such as drones to emulate their skills. Bats, unlike most birds and flying insects, have relatively heavy wings – something that might appear disadvantageous. But a recent study in PLOS Biology by Kenny Breuer and colleagues shows that bats can exploit the inertia of the wings to make sharp turns that would be near-impossible using aerodynamic forces alone. The authors combined high-speed film of real bats landing upside-down on ceiling roosts with computational modelling to tease apart aerodynamic and inertial effects."],

Hannibal could not punish them without dividing his he had no competent leadership to do so, what with one member of",
  'A group of Celts known as the Senone was led through Italy by their commander, Brennus. The Senone Gauls were threatening the nearby town of Clusium, when Roman Ambassadors from the Fabii family were sent to negotiate peace for Clusium. The Romans were notoriously aggressive, and so it is only a little surprising that when a scuffle broke out between the Gauls and Clusians, the Fabii joined in and actually killed a Senone chieftain. The Roman people voted to decide the fate of those who broke the sacred conduct of ambassadors, but the Fabii were so popular that they were instead voted to some of the highest positions in Rome. This absolutely infuriated Brennus and his people and they abandoned everything and headed straight for Rome. Rome was woefully unprepared for this sudden attack. The Gauls had marched with purpose, declaring to all the towns they passed that they would not harm them, they were heading straight for Rome.',
  "Hannibal had no intention to sit and recieve the romans in spain.Hannibal clearly considered the nature of roman power-and came to the conclusion that Rome could only be defeated in Italy.The cornerstone of Rome's power was a strategic manpower base that in theory could produce 7,00,000 infantry and 70,000 cavalry.More than half of this manpower base (4,00,000) was provided by rome's Italian allies,who paid no taxes but had to render military service to rome's armies.Not all were content.Carthage on the other hand rarely used its own citizens for war,bulk of its army being mercenaries.In any case its manpower could never even come close to Rome,the fact that had aided roman victory in the 1st Punic war.Hannibal thus understood that Rome could afford to raise and send army after army to spain and take losses. Meanwhile any carthiginian losses in spain would encourage the recently conquered iberian tribes to defect. The only way to defeat Rome,was to fight in italy itself.By winning battle after battle on italian soil and demonstrating to the italian allies rome's inability to protect them and weakness,he could encourage them to break free of Rome eroding Rome's manpower to sizeable proportions. But there was one problem,his fleet was tiny and Rome ruled the seas.By land,the coastal route would be blocked by Roman forces and her ally-the great walled city of massalia.Hannibal thus resolved to think and do the impossible - move thousands of miles by land through the pyranees mountains,uncharted territory inhabited by the fierce gauls ,then through the Alps mountains and invade italy. Even before the siege of Saguntum had concluded,Hannibal had set things in motion.Having sent a number of embassies to the Gallic tribes in the Po valley with the mission of establishing a safe place for Hannibal to debouch from the Alps into the Po valley. He did not desire to cross this rugged mountain chain and to descend into the Po valley with exhausted troops only to have to fight a battle.Additionally the fierce gauls would provide a source of manpower for Hannibal's army.The romans had recently conquered much territory from the gauls in this area,brutally subjagating them ,seizing their land and redistributing it to roman colonists.Thus securing an alliance proved to be easy. After the sack of Saguntum he dismissed his troops to their own localities."]]

```['\n'
 '  Question: How did bats evolve their wings?\n'
 '  Answer: Recent research has shed new light on how bats evolved their '
 'wings. An international team of researchers used genetic tools to study the '
 'embryonic development of bat wings and the genes involved in their '
 'formation. They also investigated the regulatory elements in the genome that '
 'control the expression of these genes. By analyzing these factors, the '
 'researchers discovered that bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs '
 'and adapted it to develop wings, allowing them to fly. This research '
 'provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of bat wings '
 'and how they evolved over 50 million years ago.\n'
 '  ',
 '\n'
 '  Question: How did Rome defend Italy from Hannibal?\n'
 '  Answer: Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by using various strategies. One '
 'of the main defenses relied on the Roman manpower base, which consisted of a '
 'large army made up of Roman citizens and Italian allies who were obligated '
 "to render military service. Rome's strategic manpower base was a cornerstone "
 'of their power, as it could produce a significant number of infantry and '
 'cavalry. This posed a challenge for Hannibal, as Carthage relied heavily on '
 "mercenaries and could not match Rome's manpower.\n"
 '\n'
 'Hannibal realized that in order to defeat Rome, he needed to fight them in '
 'Italy itself. His plan was to win battles on Italian soil and demonstrate '
 "Rome's inability to protect their Italian allies, with the intention of "
 "encouraging them to break free from Rome. This would erode Rome's manpower "
 'base to a sizeable proportion. However, Hannibal faced several obstacles. '
 'Rome ruled the seas, making it difficult for him to transport troops and '
 'supplies by sea. Additionally, the coastal route to Italy would be blocked '
 'by Roman forces and their ally, the walled city of Massalia.\n'
 '\n'
 'To overcome these challenges, Hannibal devised a daring plan. He decided to '
 'lead his troops on a treacherous journey through the Pyrenees mountains, '
 'inhabited by fierce Gauls, and then through the Alps mountains to invade '
 'Italy. He sent embassies to Gallic tribes in the Po valley, securing '
 'alliances and establishing a safe place for his army to enter the Po valley '
 'from the Alps.\n'
 '\n'
 'Overall, Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by leveraging their manpower '
 'base, their control of the seas, and their strategic alliances with Italian '
 'allies. They also had the advantage of better infrastructure and control '
 'over resources within Italy itself. These factors ultimately played a '
 "significant role in Rome's defense against Hannibal's invasion.\n"

## Beyond Question Answering: Text Similarity Search

Exa can be used for more than simple question answering. One superpower of Exa's special embeddings-based search is that we can search for websites containing text with similar meaning to a given paragraph or essay! Instead of providing a standard query like "a research paper about Georgism", we can provide Exa with a paragraph about Georgism and find websites with similar contents. This is useful for finding additional sources for your research paper, finding alternatives/competitors for a product, etc.

```Python Python
paragraph = """
Georgism, also known as Geoism, is an economic philosophy and ideology named after the American
political economist Henry George (1839–1897).This doctrine advocates for the societal collective,
rather than individual property owners, to capture the economic value derived from land and other
ural resources. To this end, Georgism proposes a single tax on the unimproved value of land, known
as a "land value tax," asserting that this would deter speculative land holding and promote efficient
use of valuable resources. Adherents argue that because the supply of land is fundamentally inelastic,
taxing it will not deter its availability or use, unlike other forms of taxation. Georgism differs
from Marxism and capitalism, underscoring the distinction between common and private property while
largely contending that individuals should own the fruits of their labor."""
query = f"The best academic source about {paragraph} is (paper: "
georgism_search_response = exa.search_and_contents(paragraph, highlights=highlights_options, num_results=5)
```

```Python Python
for result in georgism_search_response.results:
    print(result.title)
    print(result.url)
    pprint(result.highlights)
```

```Henry George
https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Henry_George
["George's theory of interest is nowadays dismissed even by some otherwise "
 'Georgist authors, who see it as mistaken and irrelevant to his ideas about '
 'land and free trade. The separation of the value of land into improved and '
 "unimproved is problematic in George's theory. Once construction has taken "
 'place, not only the land on which such improvements were made is affected, '
 'the value of neighboring, as yet unimproved, land is impacted. Thus, while '
 'the construction of a major attraction nearby may increase the value of '
 'land, the construction of factories or nuclear power plants decreases its '
 'value. Indeed, location is the single most important asset in real estate. '
 'George intended to propose a tax that would have the least negative impact '
 'on productive activity. However, even unimproved land turns out to be '
 'affected in value by productive activity in the neighborhood.']
Wikiwand
https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Georgism
['Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by land '
 'ownership, natural monopolies, pollution rights, and control of the commons, '
 'including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived '
 'privileges (e.g. intellectual property). Any natural resource which is '
 'inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical '
 'and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of '
 'common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that '
 'taxing economic rent is efficient, fair and equitable. The main Georgist '
 'policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value, arguing that revenues '
 'from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing '
 'taxes (such as on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and '
 'inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public '
 "revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen's dividend. The "
 'concept of gaining public revenues mainly from land and natural resource '
 'privileges was widely popularized by Henry George through his first book, '
 'Progress and Poverty (1879).']
Henry George
https://www.conservapedia.com/Henry_George
['He argued that land, unlike other factors of production, is supplied by '
 'nature and that rent is unearned surplus. The landless deserve their share '
 'of this surplus as a birthright, according to George. Henry George was born '
 'in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 2nd of September 1839. He settled in '
 'California in 1858; then later removed to New York in 1880; was first a '
 'printer, then an editor, but finally devoted all his life to economic and '
 'social questions. In 1860, George met Annie Corsina Fox. Her family was very '
 'opposed to the relationship, and in 1861 they eloped. In 1871 he published '
 'Our Land Policy, which, as further developed in 1879 under the title of '
 'Progress and Poverty, speedily attracted the widest attention both in '
 'America and in Europe.']
Georgism - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism
['A key issue to the popular adoption of Georgism is that homes are illiquid '
 'yet governments need cash every year. Some economists have proposed other '
 'ways of extracting value from land such as building government housing and '
 'selling homes to new buyers in areas of fast-rising land value. The '
 'government would theoretically collect revenue from home sales without much '
 'cost to current homeowners while slowing down land value appreciation in '
 'high-demand areas. Henry George, whose writings and advocacy form the basis '
 'for Georgism Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early '
 '20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas '
 'include the Commonwealth Land Party in the United States, the Henry George '
 'Justice Party in Victoria, the Single Tax League in South Australia, and the '
 "Justice Party in Denmark. In the United Kingdom, George's writings were "
 'praised by emerging socialist groups in 1890s such as the Independent Labour '
 'Party and the Fabian Society, which would each go on to help form the '
 'modern-day Labour Party.']
Georgism
https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Georgism
['Even with mostly primitive methods, land values are already assessed around '
 'the world wherever property/council taxes exist, and some municipalities '
 'even collect all their revenue from land values. Though these are '
 'market-based measures, they can still prove difficult and require upfront '
 'investment. Georgists believe that the potential value of land is greater '
 'than the current sum of government spending, since the abolition of taxes on '
 'labor and investment would further increase the value of land. Conversely, '
 'the libertarian strain in Georgism is evident in the notion that their land '
 'tax utopia also entails reducing or eliminating the need for many of the '
 'things governments currently supply, such as welfare, infrastructure to '
 'support urban sprawl, and military & foreign aid spending to secure '
 "resources abroad. Therefore, many Georgists propose a citizen's dividend. "
 'This is a similar concept to basic income but its proponents project its '
 'potential to be much larger due to supposedly huge takings from the land '
 'tax, combined with lowered government spending. It has been recognized since '
 'Adam Smith and David Ricardo that a tax on land value itself cannot be '
 'passed on to tenants, but instead would be paid for by the owners of the '
 'land:']

```Python Python
# install dependencies
!pip install exa_py openai matplotlib tqdm

import pandas as pd
from exa_py import Exa
import openai

EXA_API_KEY = ''
OPENAI_API_KEY = ''

exa = Exa(api_key = EXA_API_KEY)
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Initial Candidates

Suppose I'm building Simile, an AI startup for web retrieval.

My hiring criteria is:

* AI experience
* interest in retrieval, databases, and knowledge
* available to work now or soon

We start with 13 example PhD students recommended by friends. All I have is their name and email.

```Python Python
# Usually you would upload a csv of students
# df = pd.read_csv('./students.csv')

# TODO: add your own candidates
sample_data = {
    "Name": [
        "Kristy Choi", "Jiaming Song", "Brice Huang", "Andi Peng",
        "Athiya Deviyani", "Hao Zhu", "Zana Bucinca", "Usha Bhalla",
        "Kia Rahmani", "Jingyan Wang", "Jun-Kun Wang", "Sanmi Koyejo",
        "Erik Jenner"
    ],
    "Email": [
        "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)", "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)", "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)", "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)", "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)", "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)", "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
        "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)"
    ]
}

# Creating the DataFrame
students_df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)
students_df

```

## Information Enrichment

Now, let's add more information about the candidates: current school, LinkedIn, and personal website.

First, we'll define a helper function to call OpenAI -- we'll use this for many of our later functions.

```Python Python
def get_openai_response(input_text):
    # if contents is empty
    if not input_text:
        return ""
    completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": input_text},
            ],
            temperature=0
        )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content

```

We'll ask GPT to extract the candidate's school from their email address.

```Python Python
def extract_school_from_email(email):
  content =  f"I'm going to give you a student's email. I want you to figure out what school they go to. For example, if the email is [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) you should return 'CMU' and nothing else. Only return the name of the school. Here is their email: {email}"
  return get_openai_response(content)

# Example
extract_school_from_email('[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)')
```

Now that we have their school, let's use Exa to find their LinkedIn and personal website too.

Here, we're passing in `type="keyword"` to do an Exa keyword search because we want our results to have the exact name in the result. We also specify `include_domains=['linkedin.com']` to restrict the results to LinkedIn profiles.

```Python Python
def get_linkedin_from_name(name, school = ''):
    query = f"{name} {school}"

    keyword_search = exa.search(query, num_results=1, type="keyword", include_domains=['linkedin.com'])

    if keyword_search.results:
        result = keyword_search.results[0]
        return result.url
    print(f"No LinkedIn found for: {name}")
    return None

print("LinkedIn:", get_linkedin_from_name('Sarah Chieng', 'MIT'))
```

To now find the candidate's personal website, we can use the same Exa query, but we want to also scrape the website's contents. To do this, we use `search_and_contents`.

We can also exclude some misleading websites with `exclude_domains=['linkedin.com', 'github.com', 'twitter.com']`. Whatever's left has a good chance of being their personal site!

```Python Python
#given a name, returns their personal website if we can find it
def exa_search_personal_website(name, school = ''):
    query = f"{name} {school}"
    keyword_search = exa.search_and_contents(query, type="keyword", text={"include_html_tags": False}, num_results=1, exclude_domains=['linkedin.com', 'github.com', 'twitter.com'])
    if keyword_search.results:
        result = keyword_search.results[0]
        return result.url, result.text
    print(f"No personal website found for: {name}")
    return (None, None)

#example
personal_website_url, personal_website_text = exa_search_personal_website('Aryaman Arora', 'Stanford')
personal_website_url
```

Now that I have personal websites of each candidate, we can use Exa and GPT-4 to answer questions like:

* what are they doing now? Or what class year are they?
* where did they do their undergrad?
* what topics do they research?
* are they an AI researcher?

Once we have all of the page's contents, let's start asking some questions:

```Python Python
def extract_undergrad_from_contents(contents):
    contents = f"""I'm going to give you some information I found online about a person. Based on the provided information, determine where they went to college for undergrad.
    Some examples are \"MIT\" or \"Harvard.\" You should answer only in the example format, or return \"not sure\" if you're not sure. Do not return any other text. Here is the information I have scraped: {contents}."""
    return get_openai_response(contents)

def extract_current_role_from_contents(contents):
    contents = f"""I'm going to give you some information I found online about a person. Based on the provided information, determine where they are currently working or if they are still a student, what their current year of study is.
    Some examples are \"OpenAI\" or \"first year PHD.\" You should answer only in the example format, or return \"not sure\" if you're not sure. Do not return any other text. Here is the information I have scraped: {contents}."""
    return get_openai_response(contents)

def extract_research_topics_from_contents(contents):
    contents = f"""I'm going to give you some information I found online about a person. Based on the provided information, determine what fields they research.
    Some examples are \"RAG, retrieval, and databases\" or \"Diffusion models.\" You should answer only in the example format, or return \"not sure\" if you're not sure. Do not return any other text. Here is the information I have scraped: {contents}."""
    return get_openai_response(contents)

def extract_is_ai_from_contents(contents):
    contents = f"""I'm going to give you some information I found online about a person. Based on the provided information, determine whether they are a AI researcher.
    You should only return \"yes\" or \"no\", or return \"not sure\" if you're not sure. Do not return any other text. Here is the information I have scraped: {contents}."""
    return get_openai_response(contents)

#Example
personal_website_url, personal_website_text = exa_search_personal_website('Aryaman Arora', 'Stanford') # Note: this is a random person I found online using an Exa search

undergrad = extract_undergrad_from_contents(personal_website_text)
current = extract_current_role_from_contents(personal_website_text)
topics = extract_research_topics_from_contents(personal_website_text)
ai = extract_is_ai_from_contents(personal_website_text)

# Printing the information using f-string formatting
print(f"Personal Site: {personal_website_url}")
print(f"Undergrad: {undergrad}")
print(f"Current: {current}")
print(f"Topics: {topics}")
print(f"AI: {ai}")
```

## Candidate Evaluation

Next, we use GPT-4 to score candidates 1-10 based on fit. This way, we can use Exa to find more folks similar to our top-rated candidates.

```Python Python
# TODO: change these to fit your own criteria

def calculate_score(info, undergrad, year, researchTopics, AI):
    contents = f"""I'm going to provide some information about an individual, and I want you to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how good of a hiring candidate they are. I am hiring for AI researchers.
    A 10 is someone who went to an incredible college, is graduating soon (final year PhD ideally) or is already graduated, is definitely an AI researcher, has a lot of experience and seems really smart, and a nice bonus is if their research is related to retrieval, search, databases. Only return an integer from 0 to 10. Do not return anything else. This candidate did undergrad at {undergrad} and their current role is {year}. Are they an AI researcher? {AI}. They do research in {researchTopics}. Here are some other things I know about them: {info}"""
    try:
        return int(get_openai_response(contents))
    except:
        return None
```

Finally, let's enrich our dataframe of people. We define a function `enrich_row` that uses all the functions we defined to learn more about a candidate,and sort by score to get the most promising candidates.

```Python Python
# Set up progress bar
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
tqdm.pandas()

def enrich_row(row):
    row['School'] = extract_school_from_email(row['Email'])
    linkedIn_info = get_linkedin_from_name(row['Name'], row['School'])
    if linkedIn_info:
        row['LinkedIn'] = linkedIn_info
    website_url, website_info = exa_search_personal_website(row['Name'], row['School'])
    row['ExaWebsite'] = website_url
    row['ContentInfo'] = website_info
    row['Undergrad'] = extract_undergrad_from_contents(row['ContentInfo'])
    row['Role'] = extract_current_role_from_contents(row['ContentInfo'])
    row['ResearchTopics'] = extract_research_topics_from_contents(row['ContentInfo'])
    row['AI'] = extract_is_ai_from_contents(row['ContentInfo'])
    row['Score'] = calculate_score(row['ContentInfo'], row['Undergrad'], row['Role'], row['ResearchTopics'], row['AI'])
    return row

enriched_df = students_df.progress_apply(enrich_row, axis=1)
sorted_df = enriched_df.sort_values(by='Score', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)
sorted_df
```

## Finding more candidates

Now that we know how to research candidates, let's find some more! We'll take each of the top candidates (score 7-10), and use Exa to find similar profiles.

Exa's `find_similar`,allows us to search a URL and find semantically similar URLs. For example, I could search 'hinge.co' and it'll return the homepages of similar dating apps. In this case, we'll pass in the homepages of our top candidates to find similar profiles.

```Python Python
# given a homepage, get homepages of similar candidates

def get_more_candidates(homepageURL):
  new_homepages = []
  if not homepageURL:
    return None
  similarity_search = exa.find_similar_and_contents(homepageURL, num_results=3, text={"include_html_tags": False}, exclude_domains=['linkedin.com', 'github.com', 'twitter.com'])

  #return a list of emails
  for res in similarity_search.results:
    new_homepages.append((res.url, res.text))
  return new_homepages

# we can already get things like role and education, but we need to get the name and email this time
def get_name_from_contents(contents):
    content = f"""I'm going to give you some information I found online about a person. Based on the provided information, figure out their full name.
    Some examples are \"Sarah Chieng\" or \"Will Bryk.\" You should answer only in the example format, or return \"not sure\" if you're not sure. Do not return any other text. Here is the information I have scraped: {contents}."""
    return get_openai_response(content)

def get_email_from_contents(contents):
    content = f"""I'm going to give you some information I found online about a person. Based on the provided information, figure out their email.
    Some examples are \"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\" or \"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).\" You should answer only in the example format, or return \"not sure\" if you're not sure. Do not return any other text. Here is the information I have scraped: {contents}."""
    return get_openai_response(content)

# Example
example_homepage = ('https://winniexu.ca/')
additional_homepages = get_more_candidates(example_homepage)
new_candidate_url, new_candidate_content = additional_homepages[0]
name = get_name_from_contents(new_candidate_content)
email = get_email_from_contents(new_candidate_content)

print(f"Additional Homepages:{additional_homepages}")
print(f"Name:{name}")
print(f"Email: {email}")

```

Final stretch -- let's put it all together. Let's find and add our new candidates to our original dataframe.

```Python Python
def new_candidates_df(df):
    # get the websites of our top candidates
    top_candidates_df = df[df['Score'] > 7]
    websites_list = top_candidates_df['ExaWebsite'].tolist()

    # use those top candidates to find new candidates
    new_candidates = set()
    for url in websites_list:
      new_candidates.update(get_more_candidates(url))

    #for each new candidate, get their information and add them to the dataframe
    names = []
    emails = []
    urls = []
    for url, content in tqdm(new_candidates):
      names.append(get_name_from_contents(content))
      emails.append(get_email_from_contents(content))
      urls.append(url)

    new_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'Name': names,
        'Email': emails,
        'ExaWebsite': urls,
    })

    return new_df

new_df = new_candidates_df(sorted_df)
new_df
```

Alrighty, that's it! We've just built an automated way of finding, researching, and evaluating candidates. You can use this for recruiting, or tailor this to find customers, companies, etc.

And the best part is that every time you use Exa to find new candidates, you can do more `find_similar(new_candidate_homepage)` searches with the new candidates as well -- helping you build an infinite list!

Hope this tutorial was helpful and don't forget, you can get started with [Exa for free](https://dashboard.exa.ai/overview) :)


# Exa Researcher - JavaScript
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/examples/exa-researcher

Example project using the Exa JS SDK.

***

## What this doc covers

1. Using Exa's Auto search to pick the best search setting for each query (keyword or neural)
2. Using searchAndContents() through Exa's JavaScript SDK

***

In this example, we will build Exa Researcher, a JavaScript app that, given a research topic, automatically searches for relevant sources with Exa's [**Auto search**](/v2.0/reference/magic-search-as-default) and synthesizes the information into a reliable research report.

Fastest setup: Interact with the code in your browser with this Replit [template](https://replit.com/@olafblitz/exa-researcher?v=1).

Alternatively, this [interactive notebook](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-js/tree/master/examples/researcher/researcher.ipynb) was made with the Deno Javascript kernel for Jupyter so you can easily run it locally. Check out the [plain JS version](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-js/tree/master/examples/researcher/researcher.mjs) if you prefer a regular Javascript file you can run with NodeJS, or want to skip to the final result. If you'd like to run this notebook locally, [Installing Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting%5Fstarted/installation) and [connecting Deno to Jupyter](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/jupyter) is fast and easy.

To play with this code, first we need a [Exa API key](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) and an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Setup

Let's import the Exa and OpenAI SDKs and put in our API keys to create a client object for each. Make sure to pick the right imports for your runtime and paste or load your API keys.

```TypeScript TypeScript
// Deno imports
import Exa from 'npm:exa-js';
import OpenAI from 'npm:openai';

// NodeJS imports
//import Exa from 'exa-js';
//import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Replit imports
//const Exa = require("exa-js").default;
//const OpenAI = require("openai");

const EXA_API_KEY = "" // insert or load your API key here
const OPENAI_API_KEY = ""// insert or load your API key here

const exa = new Exa(EXA_API_KEY);
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY });
```

Since we'll be making several calls to the OpenAI API to get a completion from GPT-3.5 Turbo, let's make a simple utility function so we can pass in the system and user messages directly, and get the LLM's response back as a string.

```TypeScript TypeScript
async function getLLMResponse({system = 'You are a helpful assistant.', user = '', temperature = 1, model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'}){
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model,
        temperature,
        messages: [
            {'role': 'system', 'content': system},
            {'role': 'user', 'content': user},
        ]
    });
    return completion.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

Okay, great! Now let's starting building Exa Researcher.

## Exa Auto search

The researcher should be able to automatically generate research reports for all kinds of different topics. Here's two to start:

```TypeScript TypeScript

const SAMA_TOPIC = 'Sam Altman';
const ART_TOPIC = 'renaissance art';
```

The first thing our researcher has to do is decide what kind of search to do for the given topic.

Exa offers two kinds of search: **neural** and **keyword** search. Here's how we decide:

* Neural search is preferred when the query is broad and complex because it lets us retrieve high quality, semantically relevant data. Neural search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans.
* Keyword search is useful when the topic is specific, local or obscure. If the query is a specific person's name, and identifier, or acronym, such that relevant results will contain the query itself, keyword search may do well. And if the machine learning model doesn't know about the topic, but relevant documents can be found by directly matching the search query, keyword search may be necessary.

Conveniently, Exa's autosearch feature (on by default) will automatically decide whether to use `keyword` or `neural` search for each query. For example, if a query is a specific person's name, Exa would decide to use keyword search.

Now, we'll create a helper function to generate search queries for our topic.

```TypeScript TypeScript
async function generateSearchQueries(topic, n){
    const userPrompt = `I'm writing a research report on ${topic} and need help coming up with diverse search queries.
Please generate a list of ${n} search queries that would be useful for writing a research report on ${topic}. These queries can be in various formats, from simple keywords to more complex phrases. Do not add any formatting or numbering to the queries.`;

    const completion = await getLLMResponse({
        system: 'The user will ask you to help generate some search queries. Respond with only the suggested queries in plain text with no extra formatting, each on its own line.',
        user: userPrompt,
        temperature: 1
    });
    return completion.split('\n').filter(s => s.trim().length > 0).slice(0, n);
}
```

Next, let's write another function that actually calls the Exa API to perform searches using Auto search.

```TypeScript TypeScript
async function getSearchResults(queries, linksPerQuery=2){
    let results = [];
    for (const query of queries){
        const searchResponse = await exa.searchAndContents(query, {
            numResults: linksPerQuery
        });
        results.push(...searchResponse.results);
    }
    return results;
}
```

## Writing a report with GPT-4

The final step is to instruct the LLM to synthesize the content into a research report, including citations of the original links. We can do that by pairing the content and the URLs and writing them into the prompt.

```TypeScript TypeScript
 async function synthesizeReport(topic, searchContents, contentSlice = 750){
    const inputData = searchContents.map(item => `--START ITEM--\nURL: ${item.url}\nCONTENT: ${item.text.slice(0, contentSlice)}\n--END ITEM--\n`).join('');
    return await getLLMResponse({
        system: 'You are a helpful research assistant. Write a report according to the user\'s instructions.',
        user: 'Input Data:\n' + inputData + `Write a two paragraph research report about ${topic} based on the provided information. Include as many sources as possible. Provide citations in the text using footnote notation ([#]). First provide the report, followed by a single "References" section that lists all the URLs used, in the format [#] <url>.`,
        //model: 'gpt-4' //want a better report? use gpt-4 (but it costs more)
    });
}
```

## All Together Now

Now, let's just wrap everything into one Researcher function that strings together all the functions we've written. Given a user's research topic, the Researcher will generate search queries, feed those queries to Exa Auto search, and finally use an LLM to synthesize the retrieved information. Three simple steps!

```TypeScript TypeScript
 async function researcher(topic){
    console.log(`Starting research on topic: "${topic}"`);

    const searchQueries = await generateSearchQueries(topic, 3);
    console.log("Generated search queries:", searchQueries);

    const searchResults = await getSearchResults(searchQueries);
    console.log(`Found ${searchResults.length} search results. Here's the first one:`, searchResults[0]);

    console.log("Synthesizing report...");
    const report = await synthesizeReport(topic, searchResults);

    return report;
}
```

In just a couple lines of code, we've used Exa to go from a research topic to a valuable essay with up-to-date sources.

```TypeScript TypeScript
async function runExamples() {
    console.log("Researching Sam Altman:");
    const samaReport = await researcher(SAMA_TOPIC);
    console.log(samaReport);

    console.log("\n\nResearching Renaissance Art:");
    const artReport = await researcher(ART_TOPIC);
    console.log(artReport);
}

// To use the researcher on the examples, simply call the runExamples() function:
runExamples();

// Or, to research a specific topic:
researcher("llama antibodies").then(console.log);
```

If you would like to se the full code for this tutorial as a Colab notebook, [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Aj6bBptSHWxZO7GVG2RoWtQSEkpabuaF?usp=sharing)

## Setup

Let's import the Exa and OpenAI SDKs and set up our API keys to create client objects for each. We'll use environment variables to securely store our API keys.

```Python Python
import os
import exa_py
from openai import OpenAI

EXA_API_KEY = os.environ.get('EXA_API_KEY')
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')

            {'role': 'user', 'content': user},
        ]
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

Okay, great! Now let's start building Exa Researcher.

## Exa Auto search

The researcher should be able to automatically generate research reports for all kinds of different topics. Here's two to start:

    completion = get_llm_response(
        system='The user will ask you to help generate some search queries. Respond with only the suggested queries in plain text with no extra formatting, each on its own line.',
        user=user_prompt,
        temperature=1
    )
    return [s.strip() for s in completion.split('\n') if s.strip()][:n]
```

Next, let's write another function that actually calls the Exa API to perform searches using Auto search.

```Python Python
def get_search_results(queries, links_per_query=2):
    results = []
    for query in queries:
        search_response = exa.search_and_contents(query,
            num_results=links_per_query
        )
        results.extend(search_response.results)
    return results
```

    return get_llm_response(
        system='You are a helpful research assistant. Write a report according to the user\'s instructions.',
        user=f'Input Data:\n{input_data}Write a two paragraph research report about {topic} based on the provided information. Include as many sources as possible. Provide citations in the text using footnote notation ([#]). First provide the report, followed by a single "References" section that lists all the URLs used, in the format [#] <url>.',
        # model='gpt-4'  # want a better report? use gpt-4 (but it costs more)
    )
```

## All Together Now

Now, let's just wrap everything into one Researcher function that strings together all the functions we've written. Given a user's research topic, the Researcher will generate search queries, feed those queries to Exa Auto search, and finally use an LLM to synthesize the retrieved information. Three simple steps!

```Python Python
def researcher(topic):
    print(f'Starting research on topic: "{topic}"')

    search_queries = generate_search_queries(topic, 3)
    print("Generated search queries:", search_queries)

    search_results = get_search_results(search_queries)
    print(f"Found {len(search_results)} search results. Here's the first one:", search_results[0])

    print("Synthesizing report...")
    report = synthesize_report(topic, search_results)

    return report
```

In just a couple lines of code, we've used Exa to go from a research topic to a valuable essay with up-to-date sources.

```Python Python
def run_examples():
    print("Researching Sam Altman:")
    sama_report = researcher(SAMA_TOPIC)
    print(sama_report)

    print("\n\nResearching Renaissance Art:")
    art_report = researcher(ART_TOPIC)
    print(art_report)

# To use the researcher on the examples, simply call the run_examples() function:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_examples()

# Or, to research a specific topic:
# print(researcher("llama antibodies"))
```

This Python implementation of Exa Researcher demonstrates how to leverage Exa's Auto search feature and the OpenAI API to create an automated research tool. By combining Exa's powerful search capabilities with GPT-3.5 Turbo's language understanding and generation, we've created a system that can quickly gather and synthesize information on any given topic.

## 2. Why use Instructor?

Instructor is a Python library that allows you to generate structured outputs from a language model.

We could instruct the LLM to return a structured output, but the output will still be a string, which we need to convert to a dictionary. What if the dictionary is not structured as we want? What if the LLM forgot to add the last "}" in the JSON? We would have to handle all of these errors manually.

We could use `{ "type": "json_object" }` [](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/json-mode) which will make the LLM return a JSON object. But for this, we would need to provide a JSON schema, which can get [large and complex](https://python.useinstructor.com/why/#pydantic-over-raw-schema).

Instead of doing this, we can use Instructor. Instructor is powered by [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), which means that it integrates with your IDE. We use pydantic's `BaseModel` to define the output model:

## 3. Setup and Basic Usage

Let's set up Exa and Instructor:

```python Python
import os

import instructor
from exa_py import Exa
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

exa = Exa(os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"])
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

search_results = exa.search_and_contents(
    "Latest advancements in quantum computing",
    type="neural",
    text=True,
)
# Limit search_results to a maximum of 20,000 characters
search_results = search_results.results[:20000]


class QuantumComputingAdvancement(BaseModel):
    technology: str
    description: str
    potential_impact: str

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Technology: {self.technology}\n"
            f"Description: {self.description}\n"
            f"Potential Impact: {self.potential_impact}"
        )


structured_output = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=QuantumComputingAdvancement,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Based on the provided context, describe a recent advancement in quantum computing.\n\n{search_results}",
        }
    ],
)

print(structured_output)
```

Here we define a `QuantumComputingAdvancement` class that inherits from `BaseModel` from Pydantic. This class will be used by Instructor to validate the output from the LLM and for the LLM as a response model. We also implement the `__str__()` method for easy printing of the output. We then initialize `OpenAI()` and wrap instructor on top of it with `instructor.from_openai` to create a client that will return structured outputs. If the output is not structured as our class, Instructor makes the LLM retry until max\_retries is reached. You can read more about how Instructor retries [here](https://python.useinstructor.com/why/#retries).

This example demonstrates how to use Exa to search for content about quantum computing advancements and structure the output using Instructor.

## 4. Advanced Example: Analyzing Multiple Research Papers

Let's create a more complex example where we analyze multiple research papers on a specific topic and use pydantic's own validation model to correct the structured data to show you how we can be *even* more fine-grained:

```python Python
import os
from typing import List

import instructor
from exa_py import Exa
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

exa = Exa(os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"])
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

class ResearchPaper(BaseModel):
    title: str
    authors: List[str]
    key_findings: List[str]
    methodology: str

    @field_validator("title")
    @classmethod
    def validate_title(cls, v):
        if v.upper() != v:
            raise ValueError("Title must be in uppercase.")
        return v

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Title: {self.title}\n"
            f"Authors: {', '.join(self.authors)}\n"
            f"Key Findings: {', '.join(self.key_findings)}\n"
            f"Methodology: {self.methodology}"
        )


class ResearchAnalysis(BaseModel):
    papers: List[ResearchPaper]
    common_themes: List[str]
    future_directions: str

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Common Themes:\n- {', '.join(self.common_themes)}\n"
            f"Future Directions: {self.future_directions}\n"
            f"Analyzed Papers:\n" + "\n".join(str(paper) for paper in self.papers)
        )


# Search for recent AI ethics research papers
search_results = exa.search_and_contents(
    "Recent AI ethics research papers",
    type="neural",
    text=True,
    num_results=5,  # Limit to 5 papers for this example
)

# Combine all search results into one string
combined_results = "\n\n".join([result.text for result in search_results.results])
structured_output = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=ResearchAnalysis,
    max_retries=5,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Analyze the following AI ethics research papers and provide a structured summary:\n\n{combined_results}",
        }
    ],
)

print(structured_output)
```

By using pydantic’s `field_validator`, we can create our own rules to validate each field to be exactly what we want, so that we can work with predictable data even though we are using an LLM. Additionally, implementing the `__str__()` method allows for more readable and convenient output formatting. Read more about different pydantic validators [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#field-validators). Because we don’t specify that the `Title` should be in uppercase in the prompt, this will result in *at least* two API calls. You should avoid using `field_validator`s as the *only* means to get the data in the right format; instead, you should include instructions in the prompt, such as specifying that the `Title` should be in uppercase/all-caps.

This advanced example demonstrates how to use Exa and Instructor to analyze multiple research papers, extract structured information, and provide a comprehensive summary of the findings.

## 5. Streaming Structured Outputs

Instructor also supports streaming structured outputs, which is useful for getting partial results as they're generated (this does not support validators due to the nature of streaming responses, you can read more about it [here](https://python.useinstructor.com/concepts/partial/)):

To make the output easier to see, we will use the [rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) Python package. It should already be installed, but if it isn’t, just run `pip install rich`.

```python Python
import os
from typing import List

import instructor
from exa_py import Exa
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from rich.console import Console

exa = Exa(os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"])
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())


class AIEthicsInsight(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    description: str
    ethical_implications: List[str]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Topic: {self.topic}\n"
            f"Description: {self.description}\n"
            f"Ethical Implications:\n- {', '.join(self.ethical_implications or [])}"
        )


# Search for recent AI ethics research papers
search_results = exa.search_and_contents(
    "Recent AI ethics research papers",
    type="neural",
    text=True,
    num_results=5,  # Limit to 5 papers for this example
)

# Combine all search results into one string
combined_results = "\n\n".join([result.text for result in search_results.results])


structured_output = client.chat.completions.create_partial(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=AIEthicsInsight,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Provide insights on AI ethics based on the following research:\n\n{combined_results}",
        }
    ],
    stream=True,
)

console = Console()

for output in structured_output:
    obj = output.model_dump()
    console.clear()
    print(output)
    if (
        output.topic
        and output.description
        and output.ethical_implications is not None
        and len(output.ethical_implications) >= 4
    ):
        break
```

```Text stream output
topic='AI Ethics in Mimetic Models' description='Exploring the ethical implications of AI that simulates the decisions and behavior of specific individuals, known as mimetic models, and the social impact of their availability in various domains such as game-playing, text generation, and artistic expression.' ethical_implications=['Deception Concerns: Mimetic models can potentially be used for deception, leading to misinformation and challenges in distinguishing between a real individual and a simulated model.', 'Normative Issues: Mimetic models raise normative concerns related to the interactions between the target individual, the model operator, and other entities that interact with the model, impacting transparency, authenticity, and ethical considerations in various scenarios.', 'Preparation and End-Use: Mimetic models can be used as preparation for real-life interactions or as an end in themselves, affecting interactions, personal relationships, labor dynamics, and audience engagement, leading to questions about consent, labor devaluation, and reputation consequences.', '']

Final Output:
Topic: AI Ethics in Mimetic Models
Description: Exploring the ethical implications of AI that simulates the decisions and behavior of specific individuals, known as mimetic models, and the social impact of their availability in various domains such as game-playing, text generation, and artistic expression.
Ethical Implications:
- Deception Concerns: Mimetic models can potentially be used for deception, leading to misinformation and challenges in distinguishing between a real individual and a simulated model.
- Normative Issues: Mimetic models raise normative concerns related to the interactions between the target individual, the model operator, and other entities that interact with the model, impacting transparency, authenticity, and ethical considerations in various scenarios.
- Preparation and End-Use: Mimetic models can be used as preparation for real-life interactions or as an end in themselves, affecting interactions, personal relationships, labor dynamics, and audience engagement, leading to questions about consent, labor devaluation, and reputation consequences.
```

This example shows how to stream partial results and break the loop when certain conditions are met.

## 6. Writing Results to CSV

After generating structured outputs, you might want to save the results for further analysis or record-keeping. Here's how you can write the results to a CSV file:

```python Python
import csv
import os
from typing import List

import instructor
from exa_py import Exa
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

exa = Exa(os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"])
client = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI())

class AIEthicsInsight(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    description: str
    ethical_implications: List[str]

# Search for recent AI ethics research papers
search_results = exa.search_and_contents(
    "Recent AI ethics research papers",
    type="neural",
    text=True,
    num_results=5,  # Limit to 5 papers for this example
)

# Combine all search results into one string
combined_results = "\n\n".join([result.text for result in search_results.results])

def write_to_csv(insights: List[AIEthicsInsight], filename: str = "ai_ethics_insights.csv"):
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['Topic', 'Description', 'Ethical Implications'])
        
        for insight in insights:
            writer.writerow([
                insight.topic,
                insight.description,
                '; '.join(insight.ethical_implications)
            ])
    
    print(f"Results written to {filename}")

# Generate multiple insights
num_insights = 5
insights = []
for _ in range(num_insights):
    insight = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        response_model=AIEthicsInsight,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Provide an insight on AI ethics based on the following research:\n\n{combined_results}",
            }
        ],
    )
    insights.append(insight)

# Write insights to CSV
write_to_csv(insights)
```

After running the code, you'll have a CSV file named "ai\_ethics\_insights.csv". Here's an example of what the contents might look like:

```csv

```

Instructor has enabled the creation of structured data that can as such be stored in tabular format, e.g.in a CRM or similar.

By combining Exa’s powerful search capabilities with Instructor’s predictable output generation, you can extract and analyze information from web content efficiently and accurately.

## What this doc covers

* Brief intro to LangGraph
* How to set up an agent in LangGraph with Exa search as a tool

***

## Guide

This guide will show you how you can define and use Exa search within the LangGraph framework. This framework provides a straightforward way for you to define an AI agent and for it to retrieve high-quality, semantically matched content via Exa search.

## Brief Intro to LangGraph

Before we dive into our implementation, a quick primer on the LangGraph framework.

LangGraph is a powerful tool for building complex LLM-based agents. It allows for cyclical workflows, gives you granular control, and offers built-in persistence. This means you can create reliable agents with intricate logic, pause and resume execution, and even incorporate human oversight.

Read more about [LangGraph here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)

## Our Research Assistant Workflow

For our AI-powered research assistant, we're leveraging LangGraph's capabilities to create a workflow that combines an AI model (Claude) with a web search retrieval tool powered by Exa's API, to fetch, find and analyze any documents (in this case research on climate tech). Here's a visual representation of our workflow:

![Alt text](https://files.readme.io/a2674bdce9b576860cd8eeec735ebd8959e8a8b41d4e5fab829dbbdcae37d6b0-Screenshot_2024-08-22_at_11.50.08.png)

This diagram illustrates how our workflow takes advantage of LangGraph's cycle support, allowing the agent to repeatedly use tools and make decisions until it has gathered sufficient information to provide a final response.

## Let's break down what's happening in this simple workflow:

1. We start at the Entry Point with a user query (e.g., "Latest research papers on climate technology").
2. The Agent (our AI model) receives the query and decides what to do next.
3. If the Agent needs more information, it uses the Web Search Retriever Tool to search for relevant documents.
4. The Web Search Retriever Tool fetches information using Exa's semantic search capabilities.
5. The Agent receives the fetched information and analyzes it.
6. This process repeats until the Agent has enough information to provide a final response.

In the following sections, we'll explore the code implementation in detail, showing how we leverage LangGraph's features to create this advanced research assistant.

## 1. Prerequisites and Installation

Before starting, ensure you have the required packages installed:

```shell
pip install langchain-anthropic langchain-exa langgraph
```

Make sure to set up your API keys. For LangChain libraries, the environment variables should be named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `EXA_API_KEY` for Anthropic and Exa keys respectively.

<Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

export EXA_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## 2. Set Up Exa Search as a LangChain Tool

After setting env variables, we can start configuring a search tool using `ExaSearchRetriever`. This tool ([read more here](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/retrievers/langchain_exa.retrievers.ExaSearchRetriever.html)) will help retrieve relevant documents based on a query.

First we need to import the required libraries:

```python
from typing import List
from langchain_exa import ExaSearchRetriever
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from langchain_core.tools import tool
```

After we have imported the necessary libraries, we need to define and register a tool so that the agent know what tools it can use.

We use LangGraph `tool` decorator which you can read more about [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools/custom_tools/#tool-decorator). The decorator uses the function name as the tool name. The docstring provides the agent with a tool description.

The `retriever` is where we initialize the Exa search retriever and configure it with parameters such as `highlights=True`. You can read more about all the available parameters [here](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/python-sdk-specification#input-parameters-1).

```python
@tool
def retrieve_web_content(query: str) -> List[str]:
    """Function to retrieve usable documents for AI assistant"""
    # Initialize the Exa Search retriever
    retriever = ExaSearchRetriever(k=3, highlights=True, exa_api_key=EXA_API_KEY)

    # Define how to extract relevant metadata from the search results
    document_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
        """
    <source>
        <url>{url}</url>
        <highlights>{highlights}</highlights>
    </source>
    """
    )

    # Create a chain to process the retrieved documents
    document_chain = (
        RunnableLambda(
            lambda document: {
                "highlights": document.metadata.get("highlights", "No highlights"),
                "url": document.metadata["url"],
            }
        )
        | document_prompt
    )

    # Execute the retrieval and processing chain
    retrieval_chain = retriever | document_chain.map()

    # Retrieve and return the documents
    documents = retrieval_chain.invoke(query)
    return documents
```

Here, `ExaSearchRetriever` is set to fetch 3 documents.

Then we use LangChain's `PromptTemplate` to structure the results from Exa in a more AI friendly way. Creating and using this template is optional, but recommended. Read more about PromptTemplate ([here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/quick_start/#).

We also use a RunnableLambda to extract necessary metadata (like URL and highlights) from the search results and format it using the prompt template.

After all of this we start the retrieval and processing chain and store the results in the `documents` variable which is returned.

## 3. Creating a Toolchain with LangGraph

Now let's set up the complete toolchain using LangGraph.

```python
from typing import Literal
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import END, MessagesState, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

# Define and bind the AI model
model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", temperature=0, api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).bind_tools([retrieve_web_content])
```

Here, ChatAnthropic is set up with our Exa search tool, ready to generate responses based on the context provided.

## Define Workflow Functions

Create functions to manage the workflow:

```python
# Determine whether to continue or end
def should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal["tools", END]:
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    return "tools" if last_message.tool_calls else END

# Function to generate model responses
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}
```

## Build the Workflow Graph

```python
# Define the workflow graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("tools", ToolNode([retrieve_web_content]))
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue)
workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

# Initialize memory
checkpointer = MemorySaver()

# Compile the workflow into a runnable
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

This sets up a state machine that switches between generating responses and retrieving documents, with memory to maintain context (this is a key advantage of LangGraph).

## 4. Running Your Workflow

We are approaching the finish line of our Exa-powered search agent.

## Invoke and run

```python
final_state = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Latest research papers on climate technology")]},
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": 44}},
)
print(final_state["messages"][-1].content)
```

```c Text output
Thank you for your patience. I've retrieved some information about the latest research papers on climate technology. Let me summarize the key findings for you:

1. Research and Development Investment Strategy for Paris Climate Agreement:
   - Source: Nature Communications (2023)
   - URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38620-4.pdf
   - Key points:
     - The study focuses on research and development (R&D) investment strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.
     - It highlights that some low-carbon options are still not available at large scale or are too costly.
     - The research emphasizes the importance of government decisions in incentivizing R&D for climate technologies.
     - Current assessments of climate neutrality often don't include research-driven innovation, which this paper addresses.

2. Impact of Green Innovation on Emissions:
   - Source: SSRN (Social Science Research Network)
   - URL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4212567
   - Key points:
     - This study examines the effect of green innovation on direct and indirect emissions across various sectors worldwide.
     - Surprisingly, it finds that green innovation does not significantly affect emissions in the short term (one year after filing a green patent) or medium term (three to five years after filing).
     - The research touches on concepts like the path dependence of innovation and the Jevons paradox in relation to green technology.

3. Comprehensive Study on Green Technology:
   - Source: Taylor & Francis Online
   - URL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1331677X.2023.2178017
   - Key points:
     - This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature on green technology.
     - It includes sections on research methods, measurement of variables, and data analysis techniques related to green technology.
     - The study offers policy recommendations and discusses limitations in the field of green technology research.

These papers represent some of the latest research in climate technology, covering topics from R&D investment strategies to the actual impact of green innovations on emissions. They highlight the complexity of the field, showing that while there's significant focus on developing new technologies, the real-world impact of these innovations may be more nuanced than expected.

Would you like more information on any specific aspect of these studies or climate technology in general?
```

## (5. Optional: Streaming the output)

```python
for chunk in app.stream({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Latest research papers on climate technology")]}, config={"configurable": {"thread_id": 42}}):
    print(chunk, end="|", flush=True)
```

Or asynchronously:

```python
async def async_streamer():
  async for chunk in app.astream({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Latest research papers on climate technology")]}, config={"configurable": {"thread_id": 42}}):
    print(chunk, end="|", flush=True)

async_streamer()
```

That's it! You have now created a super powered search agent with the help of LangGraph and Exa. Modify the code to fit your needs and you can create an Exa powered agent for any task you can think of.

# Building a Hallucination Checker
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/examples/identifying-hallucinations-with-exa

Learn how to build an AI-powered system that identifies and verifies claims using Exa and LangGraph.

***

We'll build a hallucination detection system using Exa's search capabilities to verify AI-generated claims. The system works in three steps:

1. Extract claims from text
2. Search for evidence using Exa
3. Verify claims against evidence

This combines RAG with LangGraph to fact-check AI outputs and reduce hallucinations by grounding claims in real-world data.

***

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-requisites and installation">
    Install the required packages:

    ```python
    pip install langchain-core langgraph langchain-exa langchain-anthropic pydantic
    ```

    <Note> You'll need both an Exa API key and an Anthropic API key to run this example. You can get your Anthropic API key [here](https://console.anthropic.com/). </Note>

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

    Set up your API keys:

    ```python Python
    import os
    import re
    import json
    from typing import Dict, Any, List, Annotated
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from langchain_core.tools import StructuredTool
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
    from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage, AIMessage
    from langchain_exa import ExaSearchRetriever
    from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
    from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

    # Check for API keys
    assert os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"), "Please set the EXA_API_KEY environment variable"
    assert os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"), "Please set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable"

    # Set up the LLM (ChatAnthropic)
    llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", temperature=0)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the claim extractor">
    First, we'll create functions to extract factual claims from the text:

    ```python Python
    def extract_claims_regex(text: str) -> List[str]:
        """Fallback function to extract claims using regex."""
        pattern = r'([A-Z][^.!?]*?[.!?])'
        matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
        return [match.strip()+'.' for match in matches]

    def extract_claims(text: str) -> List[str]:
        """Extract factual claims from the text using an LLM."""
        system_message = SystemMessage(content="""
        You are an expert at extracting claims from text.
        Your task is to identify and list all claims present, true or false,
        in the given text. Each claim should be a single, verifiable statement.
        Consider various forms of claims, including assertions, statistics, and
        quotes. Do not skip any claims, even if they seem obvious. Do not include in the list 'The text contains a claim that needs to be checked for hallucinations' - this is not a claim.
        Present the claims as a JSON array of strings, and do not include any additional text.
        """)

        human_message = HumanMessage(content=f"Extract factual claims from this text: {text}")
        response = llm.invoke([system_message, human_message])

        try:
            claims = json.loads(response.content)
            if not isinstance(claims, list):
                raise ValueError("Response is not a list")
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError):
            # Fallback to regex extraction if LLM response is not valid JSON
            claims = extract_claims_regex(text)
        
        return claims
    ```

    <Note> We include a regex-based fallback method in case the LLM response isn't properly formatted. This ensures our system remains robust even if the LLM output is unexpected. </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Exa search">
    Create a function to search for evidence using Exa:

    ```python Python
    def exa_search(query: str) -> List[str]:
        """Function to retrieve usable documents for AI assistant."""
        search = ExaSearchRetriever(k=5, text=True)

        print("Query: ", query)

        document_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
            """
            <source>
                <url>{url}</url>
                <text>{text}</text>
            </source>
            """
        )

        parse_info = RunnableLambda(
            lambda document: {
                "url": document.metadata["url"],
                "text": document.page_content or "No text available",
            }
        )

        document_chain = (parse_info | document_prompt)
        search_chain = search | document_chain.map()
        documents = search_chain.invoke(query+".\n Here is a web page to help verify this claim:")

        print("Documents: ", documents)
        
        return [str(doc) for doc in documents]
    ```

    <Note>
      We format each source with its URL and content for easy reference in the verification step. The print statements help with debugging and understanding the search process.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the claim verifier">
    Build a function to analyze the evidence and assess each claim:

    ```python Python
    def verify_claim(claim: str, sources: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Verify a single claim using combined Exa search sources."""
        if not sources:
            # If no sources are returned, default to insufficient information
            return {
                "claim": claim,
                "assessment": "Insufficient information",
                "confidence_score": 0.5,
                "supporting_sources": [],
                "refuting_sources": []
            }
        
        # Combine the sources into one text
        combined_sources = "\n\n".join(sources)
        
        system_message = SystemMessage(content="""
        You are an expert fact-checker.
        Given a claim and a set of sources, determine whether the claim is supported, refuted, or if there is insufficient information in the sources to make a determination.
        For your analysis, consider all the sources collectively.
        Provide your answer as a JSON object with the following structure:
        {
            "claim": "...",
            "assessment": "supported" or "refuted" or "Insufficient information",
            "confidence_score": a number between 0 and 1 (1 means fully confident the claim is true, 0 means fully confident the claim is false),
            "supporting_sources": [list of sources that support the claim],
            "refuting_sources": [list of sources that refute the claim]
        }
        Do not include any additional text.
        """)
        
        human_message = HumanMessage(content=f"""
        Claim: "{claim}"
        
        Sources:
        {combined_sources}
        
        Based on the above sources, assess the claim.
        """)
        
        response = llm.invoke([system_message, human_message])
        
        try:
            result = json.loads(response.content)
            if not isinstance(result, dict):
                raise ValueError("Response is not a JSON object")
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError):
            # If parsing fails, default to insufficient information
            result = {
                "claim": claim,
                "assessment": "Insufficient information",
                "confidence_score": 0.5,
                "supporting_sources": [],
                "refuting_sources": []
            }
        
        return result
    ```

    <Note>
      The verifier includes robust error handling and defaults to "Insufficient information" if there are issues with the LLM response or source processing.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the workflow">
    Set up the LangGraph workflow to orchestrate the process:

    ```python Python
    def hallucination_check(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check a given text for hallucinations using Exa search."""
        claims = extract_claims(text)
        claim_verifications = []

        for claim in claims:
            sources = exa_search(claim)
            verification_result = verify_claim(claim, sources)
            claim_verifications.append(verification_result)

        return {
            "claims": claim_verifications
        }

    def hallucination_check_tool(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Assess the given text for hallucinations using Exa search."""
        return hallucination_check(text)

    structured_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(
        func=hallucination_check_tool,
        name="hallucination_check",
        description="Assess the given text for hallucinations using Exa search."
    )

    class State(BaseModel):
        messages: Annotated[List, add_messages]
        analysis_result: Dict[str, Any] = {}

    def call_model(state: State):
        # Simulate the assistant calling the tool
        return {"messages": state.messages + [AIMessage(content="Use hallucination_check tool", additional_kwargs={"tool_calls": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "hallucination_check"}}]})]}

    def run_tool(state: State):
        text_to_check = next((m.content for m in reversed(state.messages) if isinstance(m, HumanMessage)), "")
        tool_output = structured_tool.invoke(text_to_check)
        return {"messages": state.messages + [AIMessage(content=str(tool_output))], "analysis_result": tool_output}

    def use_analysis(state: State) -> str:
        return "tools"

    workflow = StateGraph(State)
    workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
    workflow.add_node("tools", run_tool)
    workflow.add_node("process_result", lambda x: x)
    workflow.set_entry_point("agent")
    workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", use_analysis, {
        "tools": "tools"
    })
    workflow.add_edge("tools", "process_result")
    workflow.add_edge("process_result", END)

    graph = workflow.compile()
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the system">
    Let's try it with a sample text about the Eiffel Tower:

    ```python Python
    initial_state = State(messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        HumanMessage(content="Check this text for hallucinations: The Eiffel Tower, an iconic iron lattice structure located in Paris, was originally constructed as a giant sundial in 1822.")
    ])

    final_state = graph.invoke(initial_state)
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```
    Workflow executed successfully
    Final state:
    Messages:
    SystemMessage: You are a helpful assistant....
    HumanMessage: Check this text for hallucinations: The Eiffel Tower, an iconic iron lattice structure located in Pa...
    AIMessage: Use hallucination_check tool...
    AIMessage: {'claims': [{'claim': 'The Eiffel Tower is an iconic iron lattice structure', 'assessment': 'support...

    Analysis Result:
    Claim: The Eiffel Tower is an iconic iron lattice structure
    Assessment: supported
    Confidence Score: 1

    ```

    Through this combination of Exa's search capabilities and LangGraph's workflow management, we've created a powerful system for identifying and verifying claims in any text. The system successfully identified both true claims (structure and location) and false claims (construction date and purpose) about the Eiffel Tower.

# Job Search with Exa
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/examples/job-search-with-exa

Tutorial for simple Exa searches on our front-end.

## What This Doc Covers

* The problem with traditional job search tools
* How to use Exa, an AI-powered search engine, for job hunting
* Other cool ways to use Exa beyond job searching

Finding a job is way harder than it should be. Tools like LinkedIn, Handshake, or Google are supposed to solve this problem, but they're filled with too many noisy results to actually be useful.

Here's how you can use AI to find hundreds of hidden job listings in less than 5 minutes.

At a high level, Exa is a search engine that understands your query. So, when searching for "ML internships for new grads in San Francisco" here's what gets returned:

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/5d5309c-Screenshot_2024-07-18_at_12.44.34.png)

And, by filtering for only things that were posted recently, you can make sure that the positions were new and not-filled.

But, there's actually an even better way to take advantage of Exa. You can just paste a job posting and get similar ones:

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/eb97595-Screenshot_2024-07-18_at_12.40.27.png)

## More than just jobs

Job search is really just one use case of Exa. Exa is a search engine built using novel representation learning techniques.

For example, Exa excels at finding similar things.

* **Shopping**: if you want a similar (but cheaper) shirt, paste a link to your shirt and it'll give you hundreds like it
* **Research**: paste a link to a research paper to find hundreds of other relevant papers
* **Startups**: if you're building a startup, find your competitors by searching a link to your startup


# Hacker News Clone
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/examples/live-demo-hacker-news-clone

Make your very own Hacker News powered by Exa

[Click here to try Exa-powered Hacker News for Anything.](https://hackernews-by-exa.replit.app/)

## What this doc covers:

* How to create a personalized Hacker News clone using Exa's API.
* Steps to set up and run your own news site with custom prompts.
* Customization options for the site's content, appearance, and deployment.

*Estimated time to complete: 20 minutes*

Built by Silicon Valley legend Paul Graham in 2007, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular website where users post interesting tech-adjacent content. The most interesting content often comes from small blogs and personal sites. However, these gems can be really hard to find.

Thankfully, Exa's search models are good at finding interesting sites from all corners of the web, no matter how big or small. Exa searches the web semantically, enabling you to find information based on meaning rather than SEO. We can use Exa to find super interesting tech articles without specific keywords, topics, or blogs in mind.

In this tutorial, we'll use Exa's API to create a clone of Hacker News. Here's our [live example](https://hackernews-by-exa.replit.app/).

You'll get to create your own personalized version about anything, not just tech. For instance, you could make Business News, a site that displays relevant corporate updates. Your website will automatically update to get the newest content on whatever topic you choose.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/315a2e9-Screenshot_2024-07-14_at_7.49.35_PM.png)

## Getting Started

First, grab a free Exa API key by signing up [here](https://exa.ai/). You get 1000 free queries a month.

Next, fork (clone) our [template](https://replit.com/@olafblitz/exa-hackernews-demo-nodejs?v=1) on Replit.

Once you've forked the template, go to the lower left corner of the screen and scroll through the options until you see "Secrets" (where you manage environment variables like API keys).

![Click on Secrets](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/0screenshot_2024-05-15_at_11.12.21___pm.png)

Add your Exa API key as a secret named "EXA\_API\_KEY" (original, we know).

![Add your API key!](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/0screenshot_2024-05-15_at_11.13.34___pm.png)

After you've added your API key, click the green Run button in the top center of the window.

![Run button](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/0screenshot_2024-05-15_at_10.08.03___pm.png)

After a few seconds, a Webview window will pop up with your website. You'll see a website that vaguely resembles Hacker News. It's a basic Express.js app with some CSS styling.

![What you should see](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/0screenshot_2024-05-15_at_10.12.09___pm.png)

## How Exa works

In the index.js file (should be open by default), scroll to **line 19**. This is the brains of the site. It's where we call the Exa API with a custom prompt to get back Hacker News-style content.

```
const response = await fetch('https://api.exa.ai/search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    // Add your API key named "EXA_API_KEY" to Repl.it Secrets
    'x-api-key': process.env.EXA_API_KEY,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    // change this prompt!
    query: 'here is a really interesting techy article:',
    // specify the maximum number of results to retrieve (10 is the limit for free API users)
    numResults: 10,
    // Set the start date for the article search
    startPublishedDate: startPublishedDate,
    // Set the end date for the article search
    endPublishedDate: endPublishedDate,
  }),
});
```

The prompt is set to "here is a really interesting tech article:". This is because of how Exa works behind the scenes. Exa uses embeddings to help predict which links would naturally follow a query. For example, on the Internet, you'll frequently see people recommend great content like this: "this tutorial really helped me understand linked lists: linkedlisttutorial.com". When you prompt Exa, you pretend to be someone recommending what you're looking for. In this case, our prompt nudges Exa to find links that someone would share when discussing a "really interesting tech article".

Check out the [results](https://exa.ai/search?q=here%20is%20a%20really%20interesting%20tech%20article%3A\&filters=%7B%22numResults%22%3A30%2C%22useAutoprompt%22%3Afalse%2C%22domainFilterType%22%3A%22include%22%7D) Exa returns for our prompt. Aren't they nice?

More example prompts to help you get a sense of prompting with Exa:

* [this gadget saves me so much time:](https://exa.ai/search?c=all\&q=this%20gadget%20saves%20me%20so%20much%20time%3A\&filters=%7B%22domainFilterType%22%3A%22include%22%2C%22timeFilterOption%22%3A%22any%5Ftime%22%2C%22activeTabFilter%22%3A%22all%22%7D)
* [i loved my wedding dress from this boutique:](https://exa.ai/search?c=all\&q=i%20loved%20my%20wedding%20dress%20from%20this%20boutique%3A\&filters=%7B%22domainFilterType%22%3A%22include%22%2C%22timeFilterOption%22%3A%22any%5Ftime%22%2C%22activeTabFilter%22%3A%22all%22%7D)

Once you have your prompt, replace the old one (line 28 of index.js). Hit the Stop button (where the Run button was) and hit Run again to restart your site with the new prompt.

Feel free to keep tweaking your prompt until you get results you like.

## Customize your site

Now, other things you can modify in the site template include the time window to search over, the number of results to return, the text on the site (title, description, footer), and styling (colors, fonts, etc.).

By default, the site asks the Exa API to get the ten most relevant results from the last 24 hours every time you visit the site. On the free plan, you can only get up to ten results, so you'll have to sign up for an Exa plan to increase this. You *can* tweak the time window though. Lines 12 to 17 in index.js is where we set the time window. You can adjust this as you like to get results from the last week, month, year, etc. Note that you don't have to search starting from the current date. You can search between any arbitrary dates, like October 31, 2015 and January 1, 2018.

To adjust the site title and other text, go to line 51 in index.js where the dynamic HTML starts. You can Ctrl-F "change" to find all the places where you can edit the text.

If orange isn't your vibe, go to the styles.css. To get there, go to the left side panel on Replit and click on the "public" folder.

To keep your site running all the time, you'll need to deploy it on Replit using Deployments. Click Deploy in the top right corner and select Autoscale. You can leave the default settings and click Deploy. This does cost money though. Alternatively you can deploy the site on your own. It's only two files (index.js and public/styles.css).

Well, there you have it! You just made your very own Hacker News-style site using the Exa API. Share it on X and [tag us](https://x.com/ExaAILabs) for a retweet!


# Phrase Filters: Niche Company Finder
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/examples/niche-company-finder-with-phrase-filters



***

## What this doc covers

1. What Phrase filters are and how they work
2. Using 'Phrase Filters' to find specific results, in this case filtering by a foreign company suffix

In this simple example, we'll demonstrate a company discovery search that helps find relevant companies incorporated in the Germany (and a few nearby countries) via Phrase Filters. This example will use the fact that companies incorporated in these locations [have a suffix of GmbH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GmbH), which is a term in the region similar to the US 'incorporated'.

## How Phrase Filters work

Exa's search combines semantic relevance with precise filtering: a neural query first retrieves contextually relevant documents, then a phrase filter refines these results by checking for specific text in the content. This two-stage approach delivers highly targeted outputs by leveraging both semantic understanding and exact text matching.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/1864e57-Screenshot_2024-07-16_at_05.41.13.png)

## Running a query with phrase filter

Using Phrase Filters is super simple. As usual, install the `exa_py` library with `pip install exa_py`. Then instantiate the library:

```Python Python
# Now, import the Exa class and pass your API key to it.
from exa_py import Exa

my_exa_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
exa = Exa(my_exa_api_key)
```

Make a query, in this example searching for the most innovative climate tech companies. To use Phrase Filters, specify a string corresponding to the `includeText` input parameter

```Python Python
result = exa.search_and_contents(
  "Here is an innovative climate technology company",
  type="neural",
  num_results=10,
  text=True,
	include_text=["GmbH"]
)

print(result)
```

Which outputs:

Das Familienunternehmen, das in der Nähe von Bayreuth beheimatet ist, stellt qualitativ höchstwertige Erden und Substrate her, die durch das einzigartige Produktionsverfahren aktiv CO2 aus der Atmosphäre entziehen und gleichzeitig enorm fruchtbar sind. Aus Liebe und der Ehrfurcht zur Natur entwickelte bionero ein hochmodernes, industrialisiertes Verfahren, das aus biogenen Reststoffen eine höchstwertige Pflanzenkohle herstellt und zu fruchtbaren Schwarzerden made in Germany verwandelt. Hier kannst du bionero im Einzelhandel finden Wir liefern Gutes aus der Natur, für die Natur. Terra Preta (portugiesisch für \"Schwarze Erde\") gilt als \"wiederentdeckte Wundererde\". Sie wurde vor circa 40 Jahren in den Tiefen des Amazonasgebiets entdeckt und intensiv erforscht. Das Besondere an ihr ist ihre Fruchtbarkeit. Tatsächlich gilt dieser Boden als der fruchtbarste unseres Planeten. bionero hat gemeinsam mit Professor Bruno Glaser, einem weltweit anerkannten Experten für Terra Preta, das Herstellungsverfahren dieser besonderen Erde transformiert, optimiert und industrialisiert. Der wesentliche Wirk- und Inhaltsstoff ist eine sog. Pflanzenkohle. Sie sorgt dank ihrer enorm großen spezifischen Oberfläche für optimale Nährstoff- und Wasserspeicherfähigkeiten im Boden und bietet zusätzlich Lebensraum für wertvolle Mikroorganismen. Das Ergebnis ist ein stetiger Humusaufbau und eine dauerhafte Bodenfruchtbarkeit. Das Einzigartige an bionero? Die bionero Wertschöpfungskette ist vollständig klimapositiv! bioneros Produkte bieten einer Branche, die stark in die Kritik geraten ist, einen Weg in eine nachhaltige Zukunft. Während der Herstellung unserer hochwertigen Terra Preta leisten wir einen aktiven Beitrag zum Klimaschutz. Durch die Produktion unserer wichtigsten Zutat, der Pflanzenkohle, wird dem atmosphärischen Kohlenstoffkreislauf aktiv Kohlenstoff entzogen. Der Kohlenstoff, welcher anfangs in den biogenen Reststoffen gespeichert war, wird während des Pyrolyseprozesses für mehrere Jahrtausende in der Pflanzenkohle fixiert und gelangt somit nicht als Kohlenstoffdioxid zurück in unsere Atmosphäre. Das Erstaunliche: Die Pflanzenkohle entzieht der Atmosphäre das bis zu dreieinhalbfache ihres Eigengewichts an CO2! Die entstandenen Kohlenstoffsenken sind dabei transparent quantifizierbar und zertifiziert. Tatsächlich vereint bionero als erstes Unternehmen weltweit alle notwendigen Verfahrensschritte zu einer echten Kohlenstoffsenke gemäß EBC. Der Kohlenstoff ist am Ende der bionero Wertschöpfungskette in einer stabilen Matrix fixiert. Torf ist bis heute der meistgenutzte Rohstoff bei der Herstellung von Pflanzsubstraten. Schon beim Abbau werden Unmengen an CO2 freigesetzt. Moore sind einer der wichtigsten Kohlenstoff-Speicher unseres Planeten. Moore speichern 700 Tonnen Kohlenstoff je Hektar, sechsmal mehr als ein Hektar Wald! Durch die Trockenlegung und den Abbau für die Gewinnung von Torf können diese gewaltigen Mengen Kohlenstoff wieder zu CO2-reagieren und gelangen in die Atmosphäre. Hinzu kommen enorm weite Transportwege. Der Torfabbau findet zu großen Teilen in Osteuropa statt. Um einerseits die natürlichen Ökosysteme zu schützen und andererseits lange Transportwege zu vermeiden, setzen wir auf regional anfallende Roh- und Reststoffe. In langen Reifeprozessen verarbeiten wir natürliche Reststoffe zu hochwertigen Ausgangsstoffen für unsere Produkte. Bei der Auswahl aller Inputstoffe schauen wir genau hin und arbeiten nach dem Prinzip “regional, nachhaltig, umwelt- und klimaschonend“. Nur, wenn diese Voraussetzungen ausnahmslos gewährleistet sind, findet ein Rohstoff letztlich seinen Weg in unsere Produkte. bionero - Mehr Wachstum. Echter Klimaschutz.

The knowledge of the individuals was bundled to realise a device that combines nature and technology: the CityTree.\n\nThe living heart of CityTrees is moss cultivated on hanging textile mats. The moss mats are hidden behind wooden bars that provide sufficient shade for these plants, which naturally grow mainly in forests. Sensors are measuring various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and concentration of particulates. This data is used to regulate ventilation and irrigation. Behind the moss mats are large vents that create an airflow through the moss. In this way, the amount of air cleaned by the device can be increased when pollution levels are high, such as during rush hours.\n\nGreen City Solutions collaborates with several partners in Germany and abroad. Scientific partners include the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS) and the Dresden University of Applied Sciences (HTW Dresden), both located in Germany.

# Building a News Summarizer
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/examples/recent-news-summarizer

Learn how to build an AI-powered news summarizer that searches and summarizes recent articles using Exa and GPT.

***

In this example, we will build an LLM-based news summarizer with the Exa API to keep us up-to-date with the latest news on a given topic. We'll do this in three steps:

1. Generate search queries for Exa using an LLM
2. Retrieve relevant URLs and their contents using Exa
3. Summarize webpage contents using GPT-3.5 Turbo

This is a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), combining Exa's search capabilities with GPT's summarization abilities.

The Jupyter notebook for this tutorial is available on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uZ0kxFCWmCqozl3ArTJohNpRbeEYlwlT?usp=sharing) for easy experimentation. You can also [check it out on Github](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-py/tree/master/examples/newssummarizer/summarizer.ipynb), including a [plain Python version](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-py/tree/master/examples/newssummarizer/summarizer.py) if you want to skip to the complete product.

***

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-requisites and installation">
    Install the required packages:

    ```python
    pip install exa_py openai
    ```

    <Note> You'll need both an Exa API key and an OpenAI API key to run this example. You can get your OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).</Note>

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

    Set up your API keys:

    ```python
    from google.colab import userdata # comment this out if you're not using Colab

    EXA_API_KEY = userdata.get('EXA_API_KEY') # replace with your Exa API key
    OPENAI_API_KEY = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') # replace with your OpenAI API key
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the clients">
    Import and set up both the OpenAI and Exa clients:

    ```python
    import openai
    from exa_py import Exa

    openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
    exa = Exa(EXA_API_KEY)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a search query">
    First, we'll use GPT to generate an optimized search query based on the user's question:

    ```python
    SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "You are a helpful assistant that generates search queries based on user questions. Only generate one search query."
    USER_QUESTION = "What's the recent news in physics this week?"

    completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_MESSAGE},
            {"role": "user", "content": USER_QUESTION},
        ],
    )

    search_query = completion.choices[0].message.content

    print("Search query:")
    print(search_query)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for recent articles">
    Now we'll use Exa to search for recent articles, filtering by publication date:

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    one_week_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7))
    date_cutoff = one_week_ago.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    search_response = exa.search_and_contents(
        search_query, start_published_date=date_cutoff
    )

    urls = [result.url for result in search_response.results]
    print("URLs:")
    for url in urls:
        print(url)
    ```

    <Note>
      We use `start_published_date` to filter for recent content.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get article contents">
    Exa's `search_and_contents` already retrieved the article contents for us, so we can access them directly:

    ```python
    results = search_response.results
    result_item = results[0]
    print(f"{len(results)} items total, printing the first one:")
    print(result_item.text)
    ```

    <Note>
      Unlike traditional search engines that only return URLs, Exa gives us direct access to the webpage contents, eliminating the need for web scraping.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a summary">
    Finally, we'll use GPT to create a concise summary of the article:

    ```python
    import textwrap

    SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "You are a helpful assistant that briefly summarizes the content of a webpage. Summarize the users input."

    completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_MESSAGE},
            {"role": "user", "content": result_item.text},
        ],
    )

    summary = completion.choices[0].message.content

    print(f"Summary for {urls[0]}:")
    print(result_item.title)
    print(textwrap.fill(summary, 80))
    ```

    And we're done! We've built an app that translates a question into a search query, uses Exa to search for useful links and their contents, and summarizes the content to effortlessly answer questions about the latest news.

    **Through Exa, we have given our LLM access to the entire Internet.** The possibilities are endless.

# Answer
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/answer

post /answer
Get an LLM answer to a question informed by Exa search results. Fully compatible with OpenAI's chat completions endpoint - docs [here](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/chat-completions).
`/answer` performs an Exa search and uses an LLM to generate either:
1. A direct answer for specific queries. (i.e. "What is the capital of France?" would return "Paris")
2. A detailed summary with citations for open-ended queries (i.e. "What is the state of ai in healthcare?" would return a summary with citations to relevant sources)

The response includes both the generated answer and the sources used to create it. The endpoint also supports streaming (as `stream=True`), which will returns tokens as they are generated.

# Contents retrieval with Exa API
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/contents-retrieval-with-exa-api



***

When using the Exa API, you can request different types of content to be returned for each search result. The three content return types are:

## Text (text=True):

Returns the full text content of the result, such as the main body of an article or webpage. This is extractive content directly taken from the source.

## Highlights (highlights=True):

Delivers key excerpts from the text that are most relevant to your search query, emphasizing important information within the content. This is also extractive content from the source.

## Summary (summary=True):

Provides a concise summary generated from the text, tailored to a specific query you provide. This is abstractive content created by processing the source text using Gemini Flash.

### Structured Summaries

You can also request structured summaries by providing a JSON schema:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "query": "Provide company information",
    "schema": {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "title": "Company Information",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string", "description": "The name of the company" },
        "industry": { "type": "string", "description": "The industry the company operates in" },
        "foundedYear": { "type": "number", "description": "The year the company was founded" }
      },
      "required": ["name", "industry"]
    }
  }
}
```

The API will return the summary as a JSON string that matches your schema structure, which you can parse to access the structured data.

By specifying these options in your API call, you can control the depth and focus of the information returned, making your search results more actionable and relevant.

To see the full configurability of the contents returns, [check out our Dashboard](https://dashboard.exa.ai/) and sample queries.

## Images and favicons

When making API requests, Exa can return:

* Image URLs from the source content (you can specify how many images you want returned)
* Website favicons associated with each search result (when available)


# Crawling Subpages with Exa
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/crawling-subpages-with-exa



***

When searching websites, you often need to explore beyond the main page to find relevant information. Exa's subpage crawling feature allows you to automatically discover and search through linked pages within a website.

## Using Subpage Crawling

Here's how to use Exa's subpage crawling feature:

```Python Python
results = exa.get_contents([company_url], subpages=5, subpage_target=["about", "products"])
```

This will search through up to 5 subpages of the given website, and prioritize pages that contain the keywords "about" or "products" in their contents.

## Parameters:

* `subpages`: Maximum number of subpages to crawl (integer)
* `subpage_target`: List of query keywords to target (e.g., \["about", "products", "news"])

## Common Use Cases

1. **Product Documentation**: Search through documentation pages:

```python
result = exa.get_contents(
  ["https://exa.ai"],
  subpages=9,
  subpage_target=["docs", "tutorial"]
)
```

Output:

```shell Shell

We will use GPT 3.5-turbo as our LLM.

They created a material composed of interacting particles called quadrupoles, which can exhibit unique behavior in their electrical properties. This finding has the potential to pave the way for the development of new types of electronic devices and quantum computers.\nAnother interesting development is in the field of cosmology. The European Space Agency&#39;s Planck satellite has provided new insights into the early universe. By analyzing the cosmic microwave background radiation, scientists have obtained more accurate measurements of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which could challenge current theories of physics.\nAdditionally, scientists at CERN&#39;s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have observed a rare phenomenon called charm mixing. They found that particles containing both charm and strange quarks can spontaneously transition between their matter and antimatter states. This discovery could contribute to our understanding of the puzzle of why the universe is primarily made of matter and why there is very little antimatter.\n \nOh no! Since the LLM is unable to use recent data, it doesn&#39;t know the latest news. It might tell us some information, but that info isn&#39;t recent, and we can&#39;t be sure it&#39;s trustworthy either since it has no source. Luckily, Exa API allows us to solve these problems by connecting our LLM app to the internet. Here&#39;s how:\nLet&#39;s use the Exa neural search engine to search the web for relevant links to the user&#39;s question.\nFirst, we ask the LLM to generate a search engine query based on the question.\n  import openai\nfrom exa_py import Exa\nopenai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY\nexa = Exa(EXA_API_KEY)\nSYSTEM_MESSAGE = &#34;You are a helpful assistant that generates search queries based on user questions.

Well, let&#39;s take a look for ourselves at the Google search results. It gives us the front page of lots of news aggregators, but not the news articles themselves. And since we used Exa&#39;s search_and_contents, our search came with the webpage contents, so can use Exa to skip writing a web crawler and access the knowledge directly!\n  results = search_response.results\nresult_item = results[0]\nprint(f&#34;{len(results)} items total, printing the first one:&#34;)\nprint(result_item.text)\n  \n 10 items total, printing the first one:\nCredit: CC0 Public Domain\nChopped carrot pieces are among the most universally enjoyed foods and a snacking staple—a mainstay of school lunchboxes, picnics and party platters year-round.\nNow researchers from the University of Bath have uncovered the secret science of prepping the popular root vegetable and quantified the processes that make them curl up if left uneaten for too long.\nMechanical Engineering student Nguyen Vo-Bui carried out the research as part of his final-year studies, in the limited circumstances of COVID-19 lockdowns of 2021. The research paper, &#34;Modelling of longitudinally cut carrot curling induced by the vascular cylinder-cortex interference pressure&#34;, is published in Royal Society Open Science.\nWithout access to labs, Nguyen aimed to identify the geometrical and environmental factors that have the most influence on carrots&#39; longevity. Working in his kitchen, he characterized, analytically modeled and verified the aging of over 100 Lancashire Nantes carrot halves, cut lengthways, using finite-element (FE) models normally used in structural engineering.\nThe research team concluded that residual stresses and dehydration were the two key factors behind the curling behavior. The starchy outer layer of the carrot (the cortex) is stiffer than the soft central vein (also known as the vascular cylinder). When cut lengthwise, the two carrot halves curl because the difference in stress becomes unbalanced. Dehydration leads to further loss of stiffness, further driving the curling effect.\nTheir recommendations to manufacturers include handling carrots in cold, moist, airtight and humidity-controlled environments to protect their natural properties and increase their edible life span.\nThey say the study provides a methodology to predict the deformation of cut root vegetables, adding that the procedure is likely to apply to other plant structures. The study gives food producers a new mathematical tool that could be applied to the design of packaging and food handling processes, potentially reducing food waste.\nOne of the world&#39;s top crops by market value, carrots are known for their high production efficiency—but despite this, wastage is high. Around 25–30% of this occurs prior to processing and packaging—due to deformities, mechanical damage or infected sections. Fresh cut and minimally processed carrots are a convenient ready-to-use ingredient that make possible the use of carrots that might otherwise be discarded, reducing food waste.\nDr. Elise Pegg, a senior lecturer in Bath&#39;s Department of Mechanical Engineering, is one of the research paper authors and oversaw the study. She said, &#34;We have mathematically represented the curl of a cut carrot over time, and showed the factors that contribute to curling.\n&#34;Our motivation was to look for ways to improve the sustainability of carrot processing and make them as long-lasting as possible. We have produced a methodology that a food producer could use to change their processes, reducing food waste and making packaging and transportation more efficient. Understanding the bending behavior in such systems can help us to design and manufacture products with higher durability.\n&#34;A question like this would normally be investigated from a biological perspective, but we have done this work using purely mechanical principles. I&#39;m so pleased for Nguyen—it&#39;s a measure of his resourcefulness and dedication to produce such interesting research in a challenging situation.&#34;\nOver the course of a week, the curl of the carrot halves increased—with the average radius of each carrot&#39;s curvature falling from 1.61m to 1.1m. A 1.32-times reduction in stiffness was also seen, correlating with the carrots drying out; on average, their weight fell by 22%.\nNguyen added, &#34;This was interesting research—to apply mechanical principles to vegetables was surprising and fun.\n&#34;One of the big challenges was to devise an experiment that could be done in a lockdown setting, without access to normal labs and equipment. To now be in a position to have this work published in an academic journal and potentially be used by the food industry is really rewarding.\n&#34;This project has inspired me to continue my studies at the University of Bath and I now study residual stresses in porous ferroelectric ceramics for my Ph.D.&#34;\nAs well as having to use a suitcase to collect the 30kg of carrots the experiment demanded from a farmers&#39; market, a further challenge was finding ways to use them afterward. Carrot cake, the Indian carrot dessert Gajar Ka Halwa, carrot pesto and many other dishes kept Nguyen and his flatmates fed for several days.\nMore information:\nModelling of longitudinally cut carrot curling induced by the vascular cylinder-cortex interference pressure, Royal Society Open Science (2024).

Unfortunately, googling “companies similar to Thrifthouse” doesn&#39;t do a very good job. Traditional search engines rely heavily on keyword matching. In this case we get results about physical thrift stores. Hm, that&#39;s not really what I want.\nLet’s try again, this time searching based on a description of the company, like by googling “community based resale apps.” But, this isn’t very helpful either and just returns premade listicles...\n      What we really need is neural search.\nExa is a fully neural search engine built using a foundational embeddings model trained for webpage retrieval. It’s capable of understanding entity types (company, blog post, Github repo), descriptors (funny, scholastic, authoritative), and any other semantic qualities inside of a query. Neural search can be far more useful for these types of complex queries.\nLet&#39;s try Exa, using the Python SDK! We can use thefind_similar_and_contents function to find similar links and get contents from each link. The input is simply a URL, https://thrift.house and we set num_results=10(this is customizable up to thousands of results in Exa).\nBy specifying highlights={&#34;num_sentences&#34;:2} for each search result, Exa will also identify and return a 2 sentence excerpt from the content that&#39;s relevant to our query.

Here&#39;s how we decide:\nNeural search is preferred when the query is broad and complex because it lets us retrieve high quality, semantically relevant data. Neural search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans. \nKeyword search is useful when the topic is specific, local or obscure. If the query is a specific person&#39;s name, and identifier, or acronym, such that relevant results will contain the query itself, keyword search may do well. And if the machine learning model doesn&#39;t know about the topic, but relevant documents can be found by directly matching the search query, keyword search may be necessary.\nSo, Exa Researcher is going to get a query, and it needs to automatically decide whether to use keyword or neural search to research the query based on the criteria. Sounds like a job for the LLM! But we need to write a prompt that tells it about the difference between keyword and neural search-- oh wait, we have a perfectly good explanation right there.\n  // Let&#39;s generalize the prompt and call the search types (1) and (2) in case the LLM is sensitive to the names. We can replace them with different names programmatically to see what works best.\nconst SEARCH_TYPE_EXPLANATION = `- (1) search is usually preferred when the query is a broad topic or semantically complex because it lets us retrieve high quality, semantically relevant data. (1) search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans.\n- (2) search is useful when the topic is specific, local or obscure. If the query is a specific person&#39;s name, and identifier, or acronym, such that relevant results will contain the query itself, (2) search may do well. And if the machine learning model doesn&#39;t know about the topic, but relevant documents can be found by directly matching the search query, (2) search may be necessary.\n`;\n  \nHere&#39;s a function that instructs the LLM to choose between the search types and give its answer in a single word. Based on its choice, we return keyword or neural.\n  async function decideSearchType(topic, choiceNames = [&#39;neural&#39;, &#39;keyword&#39;]){\nlet userMessage = &#39;Decide whether to use (1) or (2) search for the provided research topic. Output your choice in a single word: either &#34;(1)&#34; or &#34;(2)&#34;. Here is a guide that will help you choose:\\n&#39;;\nuserMessage += SEARCH_TYPE_EXPLANATION;\nuserMessage += `Topic: ${topic}\\n`;\nuserMessage += `Search type: `;\nuserMessage = userMessage.replaceAll(&#39;(1)&#39;, choiceNames[0]).replaceAll(&#39;(2)&#39;, choiceNames[1]);\nconst response = await getLLMResponse({\nsystem: &#39;You will be asked to make a choice between two options.

Now we have to craft some search queries for the topic and the search type. There are two cases here: keyword search and neural search. Let&#39;s do the easy one first. LLMs already know what Google-like keyword searches look like. So let&#39;s just ask the LLM for what we want:\n  function createKeywordQueryGenerationPrompt(topic, n){\nreturn `I&#39;m writing a research report on ${topic} and need help coming up with Google keyword search queries.\nGoogle keyword searches should just be a few words long. It should not be a complete sentence.\nPlease generate a diverse list of ${n} Google keyword search queries that would be useful for writing a research report on ${topic}.

This is tougher: you can read all about crafting good Exa searches here. But this is actually a really good thing: making the perfect Exa search is hard because Exa is so powerful! Exa allows us to express so much more nuance in our searches and gives us unparalleled ability to steer our search queries towards our real objective.\nWe need to our app to understand our goal, what Exa is, and how to use it to achieve the goal. So let&#39;s just tell the LLM everything it needs to know.\n  function createNeuralQueryGenerationPrompt(topic, n){\nreturn `I&#39;m writing a research report on ${topic} and need help coming up with Exa keyword search queries.\nExa is a fully neural search engine that uses an embeddings based approach to search. Exa was trained on how people refer to content on the internet. The model is trained given the description to predict the link. For example, if someone tweets &#34;This is an amazing, scientific article about Roman architecture: &lt;link&gt;&#34;, then our model is trained given the description to predict the link, and it is able to beautifully and super strongly learn associations between descriptions and the nature of the content (style, tone, entity type, etc) after being trained on many many examples. Because Exa was trained on examples of how people talk about links on the Internet, the actual Exa queries must actually be formed as if they are content recommendations that someone would make on the Internet where a highly relevant link would naturally follow the recommendation, such as the example shown above.\nExa neural search queries should be phrased like a person on the Internet indicating a webpage to a friend by describing its contents. It should end in a colon :.\nPlease generate a diverse list of ${n} Exa neural search queries for informative and trustworthy sources useful for writing a research report on ${topic}.

It is known for combining the advancements in technique with the exploration of deeper layers of meaning in artworks. In Renaissance paintings, the identification of the patron or donor often provides insights into the intended message of the artwork. For example, a painting discussed in an article from the Royal Academy[^1] was commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, the Bishop of Paphos on the island of Cyprus, and was likely painted by Titian during his early twenties. Analyzing the patronage and symbolism in Renaissance paintings allows for a better understanding of the multifaceted meanings conveyed by the artists.\nAnother key aspect of studying Renaissance art is understanding the contexts and environments in which art is encountered and viewed. The influence of the viewer&#39;s point of view and focal point plays a critical role in shaping the experience of art. Lectures provided by Wondrium[^3] discuss the importance of first impressions and explore how the artist positions the viewer with respect to the image. Additionally, the genres of Western art and the artist&#39;s media, tools, and techniques are explored in these lectures, providing a comprehensive understanding of the various elements that contribute to the creation and perception of Renaissance art.\nOverall, studying Renaissance art encompasses an exploration of not only the technical skills and innovations of the artists but also the cultural and historical contexts in which the artworks were created. By analyzing the patronage, symbolism, and viewing experience, researchers gain a deeper appreciation and interpretation of this significant period in the history of art.\nReferences:\n[1] How to Read a Renaissance Painting.

However, research published Monday in Nature and PLoS Genetics has provided the first comprehensive look at the genetic origins of their incredible wings.But to appreciate the genetics of their wing development, it’s important to know how crazy a bat in flight truly\\xa0looks.Try a little experiment: Stick your arms out to the side, palms facing forward, thumbs pointing up toward the ceiling. Now imagine that your fingers are\\xa0long, arching down toward the floor like impossibly unkempt fingernails — but still made of bone, sturdy and spread apart. Picture the sides of your body connecting to your hands, a rubbery membrane attaching your leg and torso to those long fingers, binding you with strong, stretchy skin. Then, finally, imagine using your muscles to flap those enormous hands.Bats, man.As marvelous as bat flight is to behold, the genetic origins of their storied wings has remained murky. However, new findings from an international team of researchers led by Nadav Ahituv, PhD, of the University of California at San Francisco, Nicola Illing, PhD, of the University of Cape Town\\xa0in\\xa0South Africa\\xa0and Katie Pollard, PhD of the UCSF-affiliated Gladstone Institutes has shed new light on how, 50 million years ago, bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs and went up into the sky.Using a sophisticated set of genetic tools, researchers approached the question of how bats evolved flight by looking not only at which genes were used in the embryonic development of wings, but at what point during development the genes were turned on and off, and — critically — what elements in the genome were regulating the expression of these genes. Genes do not just turn themselves on without input; genetic switches, called enhancers, act to regulate the timing and levels of gene expression in the body.&#39;,\n&#34;Since flight evolved millions of years ago in all of the groups that are capable of flight today, we can&#39;t observe the changes in behavior and much of the morphology that the evolution of flight involves. We do have the fossil record, though, and it is fairly good for the three main groups that evolved true flight. We&#39;ll spare you an in-depth description of how each group evolved flight for now; see the later exhibits for a description of each group and how they developed flight.&#34;,\n&#34;It&#39;s easy to forget that one in five species of mammal on this planet have wings capable of delivering spectacularly acrobatic flying abilities. Equally incredibly, two-thirds of these 1,200 species of flying mammal can fly in the dark, using exquisite echolocation to avoid obstacles and snatch airborne prey with stunning deftness. These amazing feats have helped make bats the focus not only of folkloric fascination, but also of biological enquiry and mimicry by human engineers from Leonardo da Vinci onwards. Recent research in PLOS journals continues to add surprising new findings to what we know about bats, and how they might inspire us to engineer manmade machines such as drones to emulate their skills. Bats, unlike most birds and flying insects, have relatively heavy wings – something that might appear disadvantageous. But a recent study in PLOS Biology by Kenny Breuer and colleagues shows that bats can exploit the inertia of the wings to make sharp turns that would be near-impossible using aerodynamic forces alone. The authors combined high-speed film of real bats landing upside-down on ceiling roosts with computational modelling to tease apart aerodynamic and inertial effects.&#34;],\n[&#34;things, gold and silver, could buy a victory. And this Other Italian cities, inspired by Rome&#39;s example, overpowered occupying troops, shut their gates again and invited a second siege. Hannibal could not punish them without dividing his he had no competent leadership to do so, what with one member of&#34;,\n&#39;A group of Celts known as the Senone was led through Italy by their commander, Brennus. The Senone Gauls were threatening the nearby town of Clusium, when Roman Ambassadors from the Fabii family were sent to negotiate peace for Clusium. The Romans were notoriously aggressive, and so it is only a little surprising that when a scuffle broke out between the Gauls and Clusians, the Fabii joined in and actually killed a Senone chieftain. The Roman people voted to decide the fate of those who broke the sacred conduct of ambassadors, but the Fabii were so popular that they were instead voted to some of the highest positions in Rome. This absolutely infuriated Brennus and his people and they abandoned everything and headed straight for Rome. Rome was woefully unprepared for this sudden attack. The Gauls had marched with purpose, declaring to all the towns they passed that they would not harm them, they were heading straight for Rome.&#39;,\n&#34;Hannibal had no intention to sit and recieve the romans in spain.Hannibal clearly considered the nature of roman power-and came to the conclusion that Rome could only be defeated in Italy.The cornerstone of Rome&#39;s power was a strategic manpower base that in theory could produce 7,00,000 infantry and 70,000 cavalry.More than half of this manpower base (4,00,000) was provided by rome&#39;s Italian allies,who paid no taxes but had to render military service to rome&#39;s armies.Not all were content.Carthage on the other hand rarely used its own citizens for war,bulk of its army being mercenaries.In any case its manpower could never even come close to Rome,the fact that had aided roman victory in the 1st Punic war.Hannibal thus understood that Rome could afford to raise and send army after army to spain and take losses. Meanwhile any carthiginian losses in spain would encourage the recently conquered iberian tribes to defect. The only way to defeat Rome,was to fight in italy itself.By winning battle after battle on italian soil and demonstrating to the italian allies rome&#39;s inability to protect them and weakness,he could encourage them to break free of Rome eroding Rome&#39;s manpower to sizeable proportions. But there was one problem,his fleet was tiny and Rome ruled the seas.By land,the coastal route would be blocked by Roman forces and her ally-the great walled city of massalia.Hannibal thus resolved to think and do the impossible - move thousands of miles by land through the pyranees mountains,uncharted territory inhabited by the fierce gauls ,then through the Alps mountains and invade italy. Even before the siege of Saguntum had concluded,Hannibal had set things in motion.Having sent a number of embassies to the Gallic tribes in the Po valley with the mission of establishing a safe place for Hannibal to debouch from the Alps into the Po valley. He did not desire to cross this rugged mountain chain and to descend into the Po valley with exhausted troops only to have to fight a battle.Additionally the fierce gauls would provide a source of manpower for Hannibal&#39;s army.The romans had recently conquered much territory from the gauls in this area,brutally subjagating them ,seizing their land and redistributing it to roman colonists.Thus securing an alliance proved to be easy. After the sack of Saguntum he dismissed his troops to their own localities.&#34;]]\n \nNow, let&#39;s give the context we got to our LLM so it can answer our questions with solid sources backing them up!\n  responses = []\nfor question, info in zip(questions, info_for_llm):\nsystem_prompt = &#34;You are RAG researcher.

An international team of researchers used genetic tools to study the &#39;\n&#39;embryonic development of bat wings and the genes involved in their &#39;\n&#39;formation. They also investigated the regulatory elements in the genome that &#39;\n&#39;control the expression of these genes. By analyzing these factors, the &#39;\n&#39;researchers discovered that bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs &#39;\n&#39;and adapted it to develop wings, allowing them to fly. This research &#39;\n&#39;provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of bat wings &#39;\n&#39;and how they evolved over 50 million years ago.\\n&#39;\n&#39; &#39;,\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39; Question: How did Rome defend Italy from Hannibal?\\n&#39;\n&#39; Answer: Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by using various strategies. One &#39;\n&#39;of the main defenses relied on the Roman manpower base, which consisted of a &#39;\n&#39;large army made up of Roman citizens and Italian allies who were obligated &#39;\n&#34;to render military service. Rome&#39;s strategic manpower base was a cornerstone &#34;\n&#39;of their power, as it could produce a significant number of infantry and &#39;\n&#39;cavalry. This posed a challenge for Hannibal, as Carthage relied heavily on &#39;\n&#34;mercenaries and could not match Rome&#39;s manpower.\\n&#34;\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39;Hannibal realized that in order to defeat Rome, he needed to fight them in &#39;\n&#39;Italy itself. His plan was to win battles on Italian soil and demonstrate &#39;\n&#34;Rome&#39;s inability to protect their Italian allies, with the intention of &#34;\n&#34;encouraging them to break free from Rome. This would erode Rome&#39;s manpower &#34;\n&#39;base to a sizeable proportion. However, Hannibal faced several obstacles. &#39;\n&#39;Rome ruled the seas, making it difficult for him to transport troops and &#39;\n&#39;supplies by sea. Additionally, the coastal route to Italy would be blocked &#39;\n&#39;by Roman forces and their ally, the walled city of Massalia.\\n&#39;\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39;To overcome these challenges, Hannibal devised a daring plan. He decided to &#39;\n&#39;lead his troops on a treacherous journey through the Pyrenees mountains, &#39;\n&#39;inhabited by fierce Gauls, and then through the Alps mountains to invade &#39;\n&#39;Italy. He sent embassies to Gallic tribes in the Po valley, securing &#39;\n&#39;alliances and establishing a safe place for his army to enter the Po valley &#39;\n&#39;from the Alps.\\n&#39;\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39;Overall, Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by leveraging their manpower &#39;\n&#39;base, their control of the seas, and their strategic alliances with Italian &#39;\n&#39;allies. They also had the advantage of better infrastructure and control &#39;\n&#39;over resources within Italy itself. These factors ultimately played a &#39;\n&#34;significant role in Rome&#39;s defense against Hannibal&#39;s invasion.\\n&#34;\n&#39; &#39;]\n \nExa can be used for more than simple question answering. One superpower of embeddings-based search is that we can search for the meaning of sentences or even paragraphs:\n  paragraph = &#34;&#34;&#34;\nGeorgism, also known as Geoism, is an economic philosophy and ideology named after the American\npolitical economist Henry George (1839–1897).This doctrine advocates for the societal collective,\nrather than individual property owners, to capture the economic value derived from land and other\nural resources. To this end, Georgism proposes a single tax on the unimproved value of land, known\nas a &#34;land value tax,&#34; asserting that this would deter speculative land holding and promote efficient\nuse of valuable resources. Adherents argue that because the supply of land is fundamentally inelastic,\ntaxing it will not deter its availability or use, unlike other forms of taxation. Georgism differs\nfrom Marxism and capitalism, underscoring the distinction between common and private property while\nlargely contending that individuals should own the fruits of their labor.&#34;&#34;&#34;\nquery = f&#34;The best academic source about {paragraph} is (paper: &#34;\ngeorgism_search_response = exa.search_and_contents(paragraph, highlights=highlights_options, num_results=5, use_autoprompt=False)\n  \n  for result in georgism_search_response.results:\nprint(result.title)\nprint(result.url)\npprint(result.highlights)\n  \n Henry George\nhttps://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Henry_George\n[&#34;George&#39;s theory of interest is nowadays dismissed even by some otherwise &#34;\n&#39;Georgist authors, who see it as mistaken and irrelevant to his ideas about &#39;\n&#39;land and free trade. The separation of the value of land into improved and &#39;\n&#34;unimproved is problematic in George&#39;s theory. Once construction has taken &#34;\n&#39;place, not only the land on which such improvements were made is affected, &#39;\n&#39;the value of neighboring, as yet unimproved, land is impacted. Thus, while &#39;\n&#39;the construction of a major attraction nearby may increase the value of &#39;\n&#39;land, the construction of factories or nuclear power plants decreases its &#39;\n&#39;value. Indeed, location is the single most important asset in real estate. &#39;\n&#39;George intended to propose a tax that would have the least negative impact &#39;\n&#39;on productive activity. However, even unimproved land turns out to be &#39;\n&#39;affected in value by productive activity in the neighborhood.&#39;]\nWikiwand\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Georgism\n[&#39;Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by land &#39;\n&#39;ownership, natural monopolies, pollution rights, and control of the commons, &#39;\n&#39;including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived &#39;\n&#39;privileges (e.g. intellectual property). Any natural resource which is &#39;\n&#39;inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical &#39;\n&#39;and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of &#39;\n&#39;common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that &#39;\n&#39;taxing economic rent is efficient, fair and equitable. The main Georgist &#39;\n&#39;policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value, arguing that revenues &#39;\n&#39;from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing &#39;\n&#39;taxes (such as on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and &#39;\n&#39;inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public &#39;\n&#34;revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#39;s dividend. The &#34;\n&#39;concept of gaining public revenues mainly from land and natural resource &#39;\n&#39;privileges was widely popularized by Henry George through his first book, &#39;\n&#39;Progress and Poverty (1879).&#39;]\nHenry George\nhttps://www.conservapedia.com/Henry_George\n[&#39;He argued that land, unlike other factors of production, is supplied by &#39;\n&#39;nature and that rent is unearned surplus. The landless deserve their share &#39;\n&#39;of this surplus as a birthright, according to George. Henry George was born &#39;\n&#39;in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 2nd of September 1839. He settled in &#39;\n&#39;California in 1858; then later removed to New York in 1880; was first a &#39;\n&#39;printer, then an editor, but finally devoted all his life to economic and &#39;\n&#39;social questions. In 1860, George met Annie Corsina Fox. Her family was very &#39;\n&#39;opposed to the relationship, and in 1861 they eloped. In 1871 he published &#39;\n&#39;Our Land Policy, which, as further developed in 1879 under the title of &#39;\n&#39;Progress and Poverty, speedily attracted the widest attention both in &#39;\n&#39;America and in Europe.&#39;]\nGeorgism - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism\n[&#39;A key issue to the popular adoption of Georgism is that homes are illiquid &#39;\n&#39;yet governments need cash every year. Some economists have proposed other &#39;\n&#39;ways of extracting value from land such as building government housing and &#39;\n&#39;selling homes to new buyers in areas of fast-rising land value. The &#39;\n&#39;government would theoretically collect revenue from home sales without much &#39;\n&#39;cost to current homeowners while slowing down land value appreciation in &#39;\n&#39;high-demand areas. Henry George, whose writings and advocacy form the basis &#39;\n&#39;for Georgism Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early &#39;\n&#39;20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas &#39;\n&#39;include the Commonwealth Land Party in the United States, the Henry George &#39;\n&#39;Justice Party in Victoria, the Single Tax League in South Australia, and the &#39;\n&#34;Justice Party in Denmark. In the United Kingdom, George&#39;s writings were &#34;\n&#39;praised by emerging socialist groups in 1890s such as the Independent Labour &#39;\n&#39;Party and the Fabian Society, which would each go on to help form the &#39;\n&#39;modern-day Labour Party.&#39;]\nGeorgism\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Georgism\n[&#39;Even with mostly primitive methods, land values are already assessed around &#39;\n&#39;the world wherever property/council taxes exist, and some municipalities &#39;\n&#39;even collect all their revenue from land values. Though these are &#39;\n&#39;market-based measures, they can still prove difficult and require upfront &#39;\n&#39;investment. Georgists believe that the potential value of land is greater &#39;\n&#39;than the current sum of government spending, since the abolition of taxes on &#39;\n&#39;labor and investment would further increase the value of land. Conversely, &#39;\n&#39;the libertarian strain in Georgism is evident in the notion that their land &#39;\n&#39;tax utopia also entails reducing or eliminating the need for many of the &#39;\n&#39;things governments currently supply, such as welfare, infrastructure to &#39;\n&#39;support urban sprawl, and military &amp; foreign aid spending to secure &#39;\n&#34;resources abroad. Therefore, many Georgists propose a citizen&#39;s dividend. &#34;\n&#39;This is a similar concept to basic income but its proponents project its &#39;\n&#39;potential to be much larger due to supposedly huge takings from the land &#39;\n&#39;tax, combined with lowered government spending. It has been recognized since &#39;\n&#39;Adam Smith and David Ricardo that a tax on land value itself cannot be &#39;\n&#39;passed on to tenants, but instead would be paid for by the owners of the &#39;\n&#39;land:&#39;]\n \nUsing Exa, we can easily find related papers, either for further research or to provide a source for our claims.

          "text": "Steps toward the mission Today, we're excited to announce that we're renaming Metaphor to \"Exa” to better reflect our\nmission. We're also launching a new type of search experience – highlights. With highlights, you can instantly extract any webpage content from each search result using a\ncustomizable embedding model. All together, we’re taking big steps toward our core mission – organize the world’s knowledge.  Why Exa? The internet contains the collective knowledge output of mankind – all the great works of art\nand literature, millions of essays, hundreds of millions of research papers, billions of\nimages and videos, trillions of ideas sprinkled across tweets, forums, and memes. Searching the internet should feel like navigating a grand library of knowledge, where you\ncould weave insights across cultures, industries, and millenia. Of course it doesn’t feel that way. Today, searching the internet feels more like navigating a\nlandfill.  Many. have. debated. what's. wrong. with. search.  But the core problem is actually simple – knowledge on the internet is buried under an\noverwhelming amount of information. The core solution is also simple – we need a better search algorithm to filter all that\ninformation and organize the knowledge buried inside. Exa is going to organize the world’s knowledge.  To illustrate the problem, try googling \"startups working on climate change\".     You get 43,800,000 results. That’s a lot of information! But how much actual knowledge? I see\nmany listicle results, but no actual startups working on climate change. That's because Google still uses a keyword based algorithm. Keywords as a filtering\nmechanism may have worked in 1998, but they don't work for an internet with a thousand times more\ncontent and an SEO industry devoted to hacking keywords. Exa, in contrast, is the first web-scale neural search engine. Our algorithm uses\ntransformers end-to-end, the same technology that built ChatGPT. This enables us to filter the\ninternet by meaning, not by keyword. Here's the same search on Exa:  startups working on climate change   Rewind Climate Change https://www.rewind.earth/ Stored on the bottom of the sea, the carbon will be sequestered for thousands of years.     Holocene — Harnessing organic chemistry to remove CO2 https://www.theholocene.co/  Harnessing organic chemistry to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere, forever.     A NOVEL PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESS TO CAPTURE CARBON DIOXIDE https://www.banyucarbon.com/ Combined they have &gt;130 peer-reviewed publications, have managed research projects worth millions of dollars, and have both presented before the National Academies of Science.     Living Carbon https://www.livingcarbon.com/  Restoring ecosystems from the ground up More biomass and faster growth means more carbon capture Our trees accumulate up to 53% more biomass than control seedlings We incorporated a photosynthesis enhancement trait to help trees grow faster Weâve developed a metal accumulation trait so trees can absorb more metals in their roots and stem These metals naturally slow wood decay, creating durable wood products and retaining carbon in wood for a longer period of time Our trees are unique in their ability to grow on degraded land with high concentrations of heavy metals As our trees grow, they can clean soil made toxic by industrial activity, store more carbon, and create investment opportunities on otherwise abandoned land      Phykos, PBC https://www.phykos.co/ We've built houses and farms and families, and we've travelled widely to see firsthand just how precious this world is.     Eion Carbon | Carbon removal that checks all the right boxes https://eioncarbon.com/ For every 10,000 tons of carbon removal, we create about five local jobs.     Climate Robotics https://www.climaterobotics.com/ In order to save ourselves from catastrophic climate change, we must automate sequestering carbon as well.     Carbon Dioxide Removal | Carba https://www.carba.com/ When biomass biodegrades, up to half of the carbon can be converted into methane, which carries 28 times the greenhouse warming potential.     Unemit https://unemit.com/ We firmly believe humanity can and will reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, and ours will be a significant contribution to stopping and then reversing climate change by driving permanent Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) of more than 10% of historical emissions by the end of the century.\t     Twelve | The Carbon Transformation Company https://www.twelve.co/ To get there, we are working with brands and industrial partners to implement our technology at scale and eliminate emissions from global manufacturing supply chains.     Note that these results don't necessarily mention the words \"climate change\" or \"startup\". Exa\nfiltered out all the noisy webpages – the listicles talking about startups – and returned the\nactual knowledge – the startups themselves. Exa's goal is to understand any query – no matter how complex – and filter the internet to\nexactly the knowledge required for that query. This is the solution to the problem of overwhelming information. Instead of 40 million\nnoisy/redundant links, we’ll filter down to exactly the pieces of knowledge needed. In doing\nso, we’ll convert an internet landfill into a library of knowledge with each and every search. That's why we chose the name Exa. Exa means 10^18th power. Google means 10^100th power. While\nGoogle aims to surface all information, Exa aims to filter all information into organized\nknowledge. And when it comes to organized knowledge, 10^18 is greater than 10^100. Why .ai? It just so happens that a creature recently emerged on this planet with a particularly strong\nneed for organized, high quality knowledge. AIs, powered by LLMs like ChatGPT, are overhauling the way we do knowledge work. But to\nperform knowledge work optimally, AIs must incorporate the internet’s knowledge. That means\nthey need to be paired with a web retrieval system, like Exa. The quality of web retrieval particularly matters for LLMs. If retrieval returns junk\ninformation, the LLM will output junk content. If the retrieval is powerful enough to filter\nthe internet to the right knowledge, the LLM will output the highest quality content possible. Most of our customers have tried search APIs like Bing and Google SERP. They come to us\nbecause those APIs just don’t work for their use cases. Those APIs work for humans, but not\nfor LLMs, which have quite different needs. We’ve been on the frontlines witnessing this transformation of knowledge work and of\nretrieval. We believe AI applications will soon search the internet more than humans. That’s why Exa wasn’t just built with AI, it was also built for AI. Building with the Exa API Exa was designed with all the features necessary for AI applications:  Filter out noisy SEO results to only the type of content the AI requests Handle long queries – a sentence, a paragraph, or even a whole webpage can be a query Retrieve the page content of any url for downstream processing  Today we're adding highlights. Highlights means Exa can instantly extract any\npiece of content from any result's webpage. Behind the scenes, we’re chunking and embedding\nfull webpages with a paragraph prediction model. Because this happens live, you can customize\nhighlights length, # per page, and specify a secondary query specific to what content you want\nto find. Customers using highlights have seen significant increases in user conversion compared to Bing\nand other search providers. It's exciting to see customers using Exa for so many applications that just weren't possible a\nyear ago, from research paper writing assistants, to lead generation research bots, to\nlearning tools for students. A mission we take seriously As builders at the doorway to the world’s knowledge, we recognize the power we wield. The\nknowledge people consume underlies nearly everything, from our politics to our scientific\nprogress to our daily perceptions of the world. We believe that organizing the world's knowledge, and thereby giving users immense power to\nfilter the internet, is critical societal infrastructure that does not currently exist. Luckily, our incentives are aligned with our values. We have no ad-based need to monetize\nattention. Our API customers want the highest quality search possible. So do we. When the\ninternet feels like a library of all knowledge, we'll know we succeeded. If you want to help us build some of the coolest technology – designing internet-scale web\ncrawling infrastructure, training foundation models for search on our own GPU cluster, serving\ncustom vector databases at scale – you can check out our roles here. And if you're ready to build with the Exa API, you can sign up here. Thanks for reading and we'll keep writing more posts soon so you can join us on the ride!  See more",

3. **Blog Content**: Gather recent blog posts:

```Python Python
results = exa.get_contents(["https://medium.com"], subpages=5, subpage_target=["blog", "articles"], livecrawl='always')
```

## Best Practices

1. **Limit Depth**: Start with a smaller `subpages` value (5-10) and increase if needed
2. **Consider Caching**: Use `livecrawl='always'` only when you need the most recent content
3. **Target Specific Sections**: Use `subpage_target` to focus on relevant sections rather than crawling the entire site

## Combining with LiveCrawl

For the most up-to-date and comprehensive results, combine subpage crawling with livecrawl:

```Python Python
result = exa.get_contents(
  ["https://www.apple.com/"],
  livecrawl="always",
  subpage_target=["news", "product"],
  subpages=10
)
```

This ensures you get fresh content from all discovered subpages.

Note that regarding usage, additional subpages count as an additional piece of content retrieval for each type you specify.


# CrewAI agents with Exa
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/crewai

Learn how to add Exa retrieval capabilities to your CrewAI agents.

***

[CrewAI](https://crewai.com/) is a framework for orchestrating AI agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks.
In this guide, we'll create a crew of two agents that generate a newsletter based on Exa's search results. We'll go over how to:

1. Create a custom Exa-powered CrewAI tool
2. Set up agents and assign them specific roles that use the Exa-powered search tool
3. Organize the agents into a crew that will write a newsletter

***

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-requisites and installation">
    Install the crewAI core, crewAI tools and Exa Python SDK libraries.

    ```Python Python
    pip install crewai 'crewai[tools]' exa_py
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Defining a custom Exa-based tool in crewAI">
    We set up a [custom tool](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tools) using the crewAI [@tool decorator ](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tools#utilizing-the-tool-decorator). Within the tool, we can initialize the Exa class from the [Exa Python SDK](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-py), make a request, and return a parsed out result.

    ```Python Python
    from crewai_tools import tool
    from exa_py import Exa
    import os

    exa_api_key = os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY")

    @tool("Exa search and get contents")
    def search_and_get_contents_tool(question: str) -> str:
        """Tool using Exa's Python SDK to run semantic search and return result highlights."""

        exa = Exa(exa_api_key)

        response = exa.search_and_contents(
            question,
            type="neural",
            num_results=3,
            highlights=True
        )

        parsedResult = ''.join([
          f'<Title id={idx}>{eachResult.title}</Title>
          f'<URL id={idx}>{eachResult.url}</URL>
          f'<Highlight id={idx}>{"".join(eachResult.highlights)}</Highlight>'
          for (idx, eachResult) in enumerate(response.results)
        ])

        return parsedResult
    ```

    <Note> Make sure your API keys are initialized properly. For this demonstration, the environment variable names are `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `EXA_API_KEY` for OpenAI and Exa keys respectively. </Note>

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setting up CrewAI agent">
    Import the relevant crewAI modules. Then, define `exa_tools` to reference the custom search method we defined above.

    ```Python Python
    from crewai import Task, Crew, Agent

    exa_tools = search_and_get_contents_tool
    ```

    We then set up[ two agents](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/Agents/) and place them in a [crew together](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/Crews/):

    * One to research with Exa (providing the custom tool defined above)
    * Another to write a newsletter as an output (using an LLM)

    ```Python Python
    # Creating a senior researcher agent with memory and verbose mode
    researcher = Agent(
      role='Researcher',
      goal='Get the latest research on {topic}',
      verbose=True,
      memory=True,
      backstory=(
        "Driven by curiosity, you're at the forefront of"
        "innovation, eager to explore and share knowledge that could change"
        "the world."
      ),
      tools=[exa_tools],
      allow_delegation=False
    )

    article_writer = Agent(
      role='Researcher',
      goal='Write a great newsletter article on {topic}',
      verbose=True,
      memory=True,
      backstory=(
        "Driven by a love of writing and passion for"
        "innovation, you are eager to share knowledge with"
        "the world."
      ),
      tools=[exa_tools],
      allow_delegation=False
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Defining tasks for the agents">
    Next, we'll define [tasks](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/Tasks/) for each agent and create the crew overall using all of the components we've set up above.

    ```Python Python
    `research_task = Task(
      description=(
        "Identify the latest research in {topic}."
        "Your final report should clearly articulate the key points,"
      ),
      expected_output='A comprehensive 3 paragraphs long report on the {topic}.',
      tools=[exa_tools],
      agent=researcher,
    )

    write_article = Task(
      description=(
        "Write a newsletter article on the latest research in {topic}."
        "Your article should be engaging, informative, and accurate."
        "The article should address the audience with a greeting to the newsletter audience \"Hi readers!\", plus a similar signoff"
      ),
      expected_output='A comprehensive 3 paragraphs long newsletter article on the {topic}.',
      agent=article_writer,
    )

    crew = Crew(
      agents=[researcher, article_writer],
      tasks=[research_task, write_article],
      memory=True,
      cache=True,
      max_rpm=100,
      share_crew=True
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Kicking off the crew">
    Finally, we kick off the crew by providing a research topic as our input query.

    ```Python Python
    response = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'Latest AI research'})

    print(response)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Output">
    As you can see, Exa's search results enriched the output generation!

    ```Stdout Stdout
    `[... Prior output truncated ...]

    > Finished chain.
    Hi readers!

    As we step into the promising arena of 2024, we bring you some of the most significant advancements in the field of AI research. The year witnessed a considerable focus on the development of AI agents and LLMs (Large Language Models). Adept, a frontrunner in the space, showcased an agent that can find apartments on Redfin, input information into Salesforce, and interact with Google Sheets using natural language. While there is no clear winner on the commercial front yet, this development promises a future where AI can perform tasks for us.

    The year also saw a continued focus on LLMs, with efforts directed towards matching the text performance of GPT-4 with smaller models. An interesting outcome of these efforts was the Falcon 7B model, which matches the performance of the 8B PaLM model. This model, interestingly, uses 100% web data for pretraining. It's worth mentioning that LLMs were also used to generate imitation models, which mimic the style of upstream LLMs. One study found that these models are highly rated by crowd workers.

    In the field of computer vision, there were numerous developments. One noteworthy mention is the ASSET paper that introduced an architecture capable of modifying an input high-resolution image according to a user's edits on its semantic segmentation map. This advancement points to the possibility of synthesizing interesting phenomena in scenes, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with digital imagery.

    As we continue to explore the ever-evolving landscape of AI, we hope to bring you more such exciting updates. Stay tuned and until next time, keep exploring!

    Best,
    [Your Name]

# Exa's Capabilities Explained
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/exas-capabilities-explained

This page explains some of the available feature functionalities of Exa and some unique ways you might use Exa for your use-case

## Search Types

## Auto search (prev. Magic Search)

| Where you would use it                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When you want optimal results without manually choosing between neural and keyword search. When you might not know ahead of time what the best search type is. Note Auto search is the default search type - when unspecified, Auto search is used. |

```Python Python
result = exa.search("hottest AI startups", type="auto")
```

## Neural Search

| Description                                                                                                             | Where you would use it                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uses Exa's embeddings-based index and query model to perform complex queries and provide semantically relevant results. | For exploratory searches or when looking for conceptually related content rather than exact keyword matches. To find hard to find, specific results from the web |

```Python Python
result = exa.search("Here is a startup building innovative solutions for climate change:", type="neural")
```

## Keyword Search

| Description                                                       | Where you would use it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Traditional search method that matches specific words or phrases. | When doing simple, broad searches where the user can refine results manually. Good for general browsing and finding exact matches. Good for matching proper nouns or terms of art that are rarely used in other contexts. When neural search fails to return what you are looking for. |

```Python Python

result = exa.search("Paris", type="keyword")
```

## Phrase Filter Search

| Description                                                            | Where you would use it                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apply keyword filters atop of a neural search before returning results | When you want the power of Neural Search but also need to specify and filter on some key phrase. Often helpful when filtering on a piece of jargon where a specific match is crucial |

```Python Python
result = exa.search(query, type='neural', includeText='Some_key_phrase_to_fiter_on')
```

[See a worked example here](/tutorials/phrase-filters-niche-company-finder)

## Large-scale Searches

| Description                                                | Where you would use it                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exa searches that return a large number of search results. | When desiring comprehensive, semantically relevant data for batch use cases, e.g., for enrichment of CRMs or full topic scraping. |

```Python Python
result = exa.search("Companies selling sonar technology", num_results=1000)
```

Note high return results cost more and higher result caps (e.g., 1000 returns) are restricted to Enterprise/Custom plans only. [Get in touch ](https://cal.com/team/exa/exa-intro-chat?date=2024-11-14\&month=2024-11)if you are interested in learning more.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Exa?">
    Exa is a new search engine offering both proprietary neural search and industry-standard keyword search. It excels in finding precise web content, retrieving clean/rich web content, and can even identify similar pages based on input URLs. These technologies make Exa ideal for enhancing RAG pipelines, automating research, and creating niche datasets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's different about Exa's Neural Search?">
    Exa uses a transformer-based model to understand your query and return the most relevant links. Exa has embedded large portions of the web, allowing you to make extremely specific and complex queries, and get only the highest quality results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Neural Search different from Google?">
    Google search is mostly keyword-based, matching query words to webpage words. For example, a Google search for "companies working on AI for finance" typically returns links like "Top 10 companies developing AI for financial services". In contrast, Exa's neural search understands meaning, returning actual company URLs. Additionally, Exa's results are not influenced by SEO, unlike Google/other engines, which can be affected by optimized content. This allows Exa to provide more precise and relevant results based on the query's intent rather than by keywords alone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Exa different from LLMs?">
    Exa is a new search engine built from the ground up. LLMs are models built to predict the next piece of text. Exa predicts specific links on the web given their relevance to a query. LLMs have intelligence, and are getting smarter over time as new models are trained. Exa connects these intelligences to the web.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can Exa be used in an LLM?">
    Exa enhances LLMs by supplying high-quality, relevant web content, minimizing hallucination and outdated responses. An LLM can take a user's query, use Exa to find pertinent web content, and generate answers based on reliable, up-to-date information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Exa compare to other search APIs?">
    Exa.ai offers unique capabilities:

    * Neural Search Technology: Uses transformers for semantic understanding, handling complex queries based on meaning.
    * Natural Language Queries: Processes and understands natural language queries for more accurate results.
    * Instant Content Retrieval: Instantly returns clean and parsed content for any page in its index.
    * Large-scale Searches: Capable of returning thousands of results for automatic processing, ideal for batch use cases.
    * Content Highlights: Extracts relevant excerpts or highlights from retrieved content for targeted information.

    Exa enhances LLMs by supplying high-quality, relevant web content, minimizing hallucination and outdated responses. An LLM can take a user's query, use Exa to find pertinent web content, and generate answers based on reliable, up-to-date information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often is the index updated?">
    We update our index every two minutes, and are constantly adding batches of new links. We target the highest quality web pages. Our clients oftentimes request specific domains to be more deeply covered - if there is a use-case we can unlock by additional domain coverage in our index, please contact us.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's our roadmap?">
    * The ability to create arbitrary custom datasets by powerfully searching over our index
    * Support arbitrary non-neural filters
    * Build a (much) larger index
    * Solve search. No, really.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does similarity search work?">
    When you search using a URL, Exa crawls the URL, parses the main content from the HTML, and searches the index with that parsed content.

    The model chooses webpages which it predicts are talked about in similar ways to the prompt URL. That means the model considers a range of factors about the page, including the text style, the domain, and the main ideas inside the text.

    Similarity search is natural extension for a neural search engine like Exa, and something that's difficult with keyword search engines like google
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What security measures does Exa take?">
    We have robust policies and everything we do is either in standard cloud services, or built in house (e.g., we have our own vector database that we serve in house, our own GPU cluster, our own query model and our own SERP solution). In addition to this, we can offer unique security arrangements like zero data retention as part of a custom enterprise agreement just chat to us!

# How Exa Search Works
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/how-exa-search-works

Exa is a novel search engine that utilizes the latest advancements in AI language processing to return the best possible results.

***

## Introducing neural searches via 'next-link prediction'

At Exa, we've built our very own index of high quality web content, and have trained a model to query this index powered by the same embeddings-based technology that makes modern LLMs so powerful.

By using embeddings, we move beyond keyword searches to use 'next-link prediction', understanding the semantic content of queries and indexed documents. This method predicts which web links are most relevant based on the semantic meaning, not just direct word matches.

By doing this, our model anticipates the most relevant links by understanding complex queries, including indirect or thematic relationships. This approach is especially effective for exploratory searches, where precise terms may be unknown, or where queries demand many, often semantically dense, layered filters.

## Combining neural and keyword - the best of both worlds through Exa Auto search

Sometimes keyword search is the best way to query the web - for instance, you may have a specific word or piece of jargon that you want to match explicitly with results (often the case with proper nouns like place-names). In these cases, semantic searches are not the most useful.

To ensure our engine is comprehensive, we have built keyword search in parallel to our novel neural search capability. This means Exa is an 'all-in-one' search solution, no matter what your query needs are.

Lastly, we surface both query archetypes through 'Auto search', to give users the best of both worlds - we have built a small categorization model that understands your query, our search infrastructure and therefore routes your particular query to the best matched search type.

See here for the way we set Auto search in a simple Python example. Type has options `neural`, `keyword` or `auto`.

At one point, Exa auto Auto search was named Magic Search - this has been changed

```Python Python
result = exa.search_and_contents(
  "hottest AI startups",
  type="auto",
)
```


# RAG with LangChain
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/langchain

How to use Exa's integration with LangChain to perform RAG.

***

LangChain is a framework for building applications that combine LLMs with data, APIs and other tools. In this guide, we'll go over how to use Exa's LangChain integration to perform RAG with the following steps:

1. Set up Exa's LangChain integration and use Exa to retrieve relevant content
2. Connect this content to a toolchain that uses OpenAI's LLM for generation

<Info> See a YouTube tutorial of a very similar setup by the LangChain team [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA1cHGACXCo). </Info>

<Info> See the full reference from LangChain [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/exa%5Fsearch/). </Info>

***

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-requisites and installation">
    Install the core OpenAI and Exa LangChain libraries

    ```Bash Bash
    pip install langchain-openai langchain-exa
    ```

    <Note> Ensure API keys are initialized properly. For LangChain libraries, the environment variable names are `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `EXA_API_KEY` for OpenAI and Exa keys respectively. </Note>

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Exa Search to power a LangChain Tool">
    Set up a Retriever tool using `ExaSearchRetriever`. This is a retriever that connects to Exa Search to find relevant documents via semantic search. First import the relevant libraries and instantiate the ExaSearchRetriever.

    ```Python Python
    # load the environment variables
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    from langchain_exa import ExaSearchRetriever
    from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
    from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

    # Define our retriever to use Exa Search, grabbing 3 results and parsing highlights from each result
    retriever = ExaSearchRetriever(api_key=os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"), k=3, highlights=True)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a prompt template (optional)">
    We use a LangChain [PromptTemplate](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model%5Fio/prompts/quick%5Fstart/#prompttemplate) to define a template of placeholder to parse out URLs and Highlights from the Exa retriever.

    ```Python Python
    # Define a document prompt template using XML-like stags
    document_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
    <source>
        <url>{url}</url>
        <highlights>{highlights}</highlights>
    </source>
    """)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Parse the URL and content from Exa results">
    We use a [Runnable Lambda](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain%5Fcore.runnables.base.RunnableLambda.html) to parse out the URL and Highlights attributes from the Exa Search results then pass this to the prompt template above

    ```Python Python
    # Create a Runnable Lambda that parses highlights and URL attributes from the retriever and passes to our document prompt from above
    document_chain = RunnableLambda(
        lambda document: {
            "highlights": document.metadata["highlights"],
            "url": document.metadata["url"]
        }
    ) | document_prompt
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Join Exa results and content for retrieval">
    Complete the retrieval chain by stitching together the Exa retriever, the parser and a short lambda function - this is crucial for passing the result as a single string as context for the LLM in the next step.

    ```Python Python
    # Define the retrieval chain - Exa search results => grab attributes and parse into XML => join into a single string to feed as context in next steps
    retrieval_chain = retriever | document_chain.map() | (lambda docs: "\n".join([i.text for i in docs]))
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up the rest of the toolchain including OpenAI for generation">
    In this step, we define the system prompt with Query and Context template inputs to be grabbed from the user and Exa Search respectively. First, once again import the relevant libraries and components from LangChains libraries

    ```Python Python
    from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableParallel
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
    ```

    Then we define a generation prompt - the prompt template that is used with context from Exa to perform RAG.

    ```Python Python
    # Define core prompt template
    generation_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", "You are an expert research assistant. You use xml-formatted context to research people's questions."),
        ("human", """
    Please answer the following query based on the provided context. Please cite your sources at the end of your response.:

    Query: {query}
    ---
    <context>
    {context}
    </context>
    """)
    ])
    ```

    We set the generation [LLM to OpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/chat/openai/), then connect everything with a [RunnableParallel](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression%5Flanguage/primitives/parallel/) parallel connection. The generation prompt, containing the query and context, is then passed to the LLM and [parsed for better output representation](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/output%5Fparsers/langchain%5Fcore.output%5Fparsers.string.StrOutputParser.html).

    ```Python Python
    # Use OpenAI for generation
    llm = ChatOpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

    # Simple string parsing for trhe output
    output_parser = StrOutputParser()

    # Connect the chain, including parallel connection for query from user and context from Exa retriever chain in step 2.
    chain = RunnableParallel({
        "query": RunnablePassthrough(),
        "context": retrieval_chain,
    }) | generation_prompt | llm | output_parser
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running the full RAG toolchain">
    Let's [invoke](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression%5Flanguage/interface/#invoke) the chain:

    ```Python Python
    result = chain.invoke("Latest research on climate change innovation")

    print(result)
    ```

    And have a look at the output (newlines parsed):

    ```Stdout Stdout
    'Based on the provided context, the latest research on climate change innovation reveals several important findings:
    1. Innovation in response to climate change: A study examined how innovation responds to climate change by analyzing a panel dataset of 70 countries. The study found that the number of climate-change-related innovations is positively correlated with increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions from gas and liquid fuels, mainly from natural gases and petroleum. However, it is negatively correlated with increases in carbon dioxide emissions from solid fuel consumption, mainly from coal, and other greenhouse gas emissions. The research also highlighted that government investment does not always influence decisions to develop and patent climate technologies. This study contributes to the environmental innovation literature by providing insights on how innovation reacts to changes in major climate change factors.
    2. Climate tech funding and attention: During the period of 2010-2022, outside of the US, China, EU, and India, only 8% of total climate venture capital activity came from the rest of the world. This concentration of funding and attention in specific regions may be hindering the reach of climate tech solutions to low-income communities and developing countries, which are already feeling the effects of climate change but lack the necessary resources to address them effectively.
    3. Research funding allocation: A study from the University of Sussex Business School analyzed research funding for climate and energy research from 1990 to 2020. The research found that 36% of funding was allocated to climate adaptation, while 28% went to studying how to clean up the energy system. Other significant shares of funding were allocated to transport and mobility (13%), geoengineering (12%), and industrial decarbonization (11%). The majority of the funding went to researchers in wealthy, Western countries, which may not be the most vulnerable to the immediate impacts of climate change.

# RAG with LlamaIndex
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/llamaindex

A quick-start guide on how to add Exa retrieval to a LlamaIndex Agent Application.

***

LlamaIndex is a framework for building LLM applications powered by structured data. In this guide, we'll use Exa's LlamaIndex integration to:

1. Specify Exa's Search and Retrieve Highlight Tool as a LlamaIndex retriever
2. Set up an OpenAI Agent that uses this tool in its response generation

***

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-requisites and installation">
    Install the llama-index, llama-index core, llama-index-tools-exa libraries. OpenAI dependencies are within the core library, so we don't need to specify that.

    ```Python Python
    pip install llama-index llama-index-core llama-index-tools-exa
    ```

    Also ensure API keys are initialized properly. The following code uses the `EXA_API_KEY` as the relevant environment variable name.

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instantiate Exa tool">
    Import the relevant Exa integration library and instantiate LlamaIndex's `ExaToolSpec`.

    ```Python Python
    from llama_index.tools.exa import ExaToolSpec
    import os

    exa_tool = ExaToolSpec(
        api_key=os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"],
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the Exa method to use">
    For this example, we are only interested in passing the [search\_and\_retrieve\_highlights](search) method to our agent, so we specify this using the `.to_tool_list`LlamaIndex method. We also pass `current_date`, a simple utility so our agent knows the current date.

    ```Python Python
    print('Tools that are provide by Exa LlamdaIndex integration:')
    print('\n'.join(map(str, (exa_tool.spec_functions))))

    search_and_retrieve_highlights_tool = exa_tool.to_tool_list(
        spec_functions=["search_and_retrieve_highlights", "current_date"]
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up an OpenAI Agent and make Exa-powered requests">
    Set up the [OpenAIAgent](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/Chatbot%5FSEC/), passing the filtered down toolset from above.

    ```Python Python
    from llama_index.agent.openai import OpenAIAgent

    agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(
        search_and_retrieve_highlights_tool,
        verbose=True,
    )
    ```

    We can then use the chat method to interact with the agent.

    ```Python Python
    agent.chat(
        "Can you summarize the news from the last month related to the US stock market?"
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sample outputs">

# OpenAI Exa Wrapper
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/openai

Enhance your OpenAI chat completetions with a simple Exa wrapper that handles search, chunking and prompting.

***

Exa is designed from the ground up to enable seamless, accurate, and performant RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Exa provides factual, up to date information needed to ground LLM generations.

But good RAG requires more than just great search. The client needs to decide *when* to use RAG, with *what* queries. They need to handle chunking, prompting, and chaining LLM calls. We provide the Exa OpenAI wrapper that, **with one line of code**, does all that and turns any OpenAI chat completion into an Exa-powered RAG system.

***

## Get Started

First, create an account and grab a free API key.

<Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Exa and OpenAI python libraries">
    ```Shell Shell
    pip install openai exa_py
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Instantiate Clients">
    Import and instantiate the Exa and OpenAI clients.

    <Note> Make sure to obtain your API keys from OpenAI and Exa and replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `EXA_API_KEY` with your actual keys.</Note>

    ```Python Python
    from openai import OpenAI
    openai = OpenAI(api_key='OPENAI_API_KEY')

    from exa_py import Exa
    exa = Exa('EXA_API_KEY')
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wrap the OpenAI client">
    The `Exa.wrap` method takes your existing OpenAI client and wraps it with Exa-powered RAG capabilities.

    ```Python Python
    exa_openai = exa.wrap(openai)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Call the wrapped client">
    The wrapped client works exactly like the native OpenAI client, except that it automatically improves your completions with relevant search results.

    <Info> The Exa OpenAI wrapper supports any model that [supports function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). </Info>

    ```Python Python
    completion = exa_openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the latest climate tech news?"}]
    )

    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Example output">
    ```Stdout Stdout
    Here are some of the latest climate tech news articles:

    1. **Title:** [The world’s on the verge of a carbon storage boom](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/12/1093477/the-worlds-on-the-verge-of-a-carbon-storage-boom/)
        - **Summary:** Companies are planning to drill boreholes to inject carbon dioxide deep underground for storage, marking a significant trend in carbon capture projects driven by subsidies and climate targets.

    2. **Title:** [Ground Floor Green: Early Stage Climate VC](https://techcrunch.com/video/ground-floor-green-early-stage-climate-vc/)
        - **Summary:** Climate tech investment is on the rise, with a focus on smarter investments in early-stage companies. The challenge lies in balancing hope and hype in selecting winners.

    3. **Title:** [Climate tech startups raised nearly $40 billion in funding last year. Check out 5 of the best pitch decks that caught the eyes of investors.](https://www.businessinsider.com/5-climate-tech-pitch-decks-investors-2022-6)
        - **Summary:** Climate tech startups raised nearly $40 billion in funding in 2021, with a focus on areas like carbon accounting and market plays. The top areas for emissions reduction received only a fraction of overall investment, indicating untapped potential.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="End-to-end code example">
    Below is a code block that puts together all of the above. You can copy it into any Python script or Jupyter notebook to test out a complete RAG example.

    ```Python Python
    from openai import OpenAI
    openai = OpenAI(api_key='OPENAI_API_KEY')

    from exa_py import Exa
    exa = Exa('EXA_API_KEY')

    exa_openai = exa.wrap(openai)

    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "How can I optimally integrate rag into my app"}]

    # exa_openai.chat.completions.create("gpt-4-turbo", messages)
    completion = exa_openai.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the latest climate tech news?"}]
        )

    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Example with multiple questions">
    Here is a slightly more advanced example that shows how to use the wrapper to answer multiple questions.

    ```Python Python
    exa_openai = exa.wrap(openai)

    questions = [
        "How did bats evolve their wings?",
        "How did Rome defend Italy from Hannibal?",
    ]

    for question in questions:
        completion = exa_openai.chat.completions.create( # calling the wrapper
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]
        )

        print(f"Question: {question}\nAnswer: {completion.choices[0].message.content}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Further configuration options and advanced usage

While the default settings work well for most use cases, the Exa OpenAI wrapper's `chat.completions.create()` method allows you to fine-tune the following parameters.

## Option to include Exa results

`use_exa` specifies whether to include Exa results for a given request:

* `auto` Exa will intelligently determine whether to include results
* `required` Exa results will always be included
* `none` Exa results will never be included

```Python Python
completion = exa_openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    use_exa="required"
)
```

## Number of results

`num_results` specifies how many search results Exa should retrieve (defaults to 3 results).

```Python Python
exa_openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    num_results=1
)
```

## Maximum result length

`result_max_len` specifies the maximum length of each Exa result (defaults to 2048 characters).

<Note> This is measured in characters, not tokens. </Note>

```Python Python
exa_openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    result_max_len=1024
)
```

## Search parameters

The Exa OpenAI wrapper supports any parameters that the `exa.search()` function accepts. You can find a list of all the parameters [here](search).

```Python Python
exa_openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=messages,
    include_domains=["arxiv.org"],
    category="research paper",
    start_published_date="2019-01-01"
)
```


# OpenAI Responses API
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/openai-responses-api-with-exa

Exa's web search can now be used with OpenAI's new Response API. This lets you add live web search to your AI app using OpenAI's function calling feature.

## What is Exa?

Exa is the search engine built for AI. It finds information from across the web and delivers both links and the actual content from pages, making it easy to use with AI models.

Exa uses neural search technology to understand the meaning of queries, not just keywords. The API works with both semantic search and traditional keyword methods.

***

## Get Started

First, you'll need API keys from both OpenAI and Exa:

* Get your Exa API key from the [Exa Dashboard](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)
* Get your OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Python Example

Here's a complete example using Python:

```python
import json
from openai import OpenAI
from exa_py import Exa

OPENAI_API_KEY = ""  # Add your OpenAI API key here
EXA_API_KEY = ""     # Add your Exa API key here

# Define the tool for Exa web search

## JavaScript Example

Here's the same example using JavaScript:

```javascript
const OpenAI = require('openai');
const exaModule = require('exa-js');
const Exa = exaModule.default;

// Initialize API clients with API keys
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: '' });  // Add your OpenAI API key here
const exa = new Exa('');                    // Add your Exa API key here

// Define websearch tool
const tools = [{
  type: 'function',
  name: 'exa_websearch',
  description: 'Search the web using Exa. Provide relevant links in your answer.',
  parameters: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      query: {
        type: 'string',
        description: 'Search query for Exa.'
      }
    },
    required: ['query'],
    additionalProperties: false
  },
  strict: true,
}];

// Define the system message
const systemMessage = { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant. Use exa_websearch to find info when relevant. Always list sources.' };

async function run_exa_search(userQuery) {
  // Create messages with the dynamic user query
  const messages = [
    systemMessage,
    { role: 'user', content: userQuery }
  ];

  // Initial request to OpenAI
  console.log('Sending initial request to OpenAI...');
  let response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    input: messages,
    tools
  });

  console.log('Initial OpenAI Response:', JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));

  // Check if the model wants to use the search function
  const functionCall = response.output.find(item => 
    item.type === 'function_call' && item.name === 'exa_websearch');

  if (functionCall) {
    const query = JSON.parse(functionCall.arguments).query;

    // Execute search with Exa API
    const searchResults = await exa.searchAndContents(query, {
      type: 'auto',
      text: {
        maxCharacters: 4000
      }
    });

    // Store search results for later use in formatting
    const citations = searchResults.results.map(result => ({
      url: result.url,
      title: result.title
    }));

    // Add function call and search results to the conversation
    messages.push(functionCall);
    messages.push({
      type: 'function_call_output',
      call_id: functionCall.call_id,
      output: JSON.stringify(searchResults)
    });

    // Send follow-up request to OpenAI with search results
    console.log('Sending follow-up request with search results to OpenAI...');
    response = await openai.responses.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o',
      input: messages,
      tools
    });
    
    // Format the final response to include citations
    if (response.output_text) {
      // Add citations to the final output
      const formattedResponse = formatResponseWithCitations(response.output_text, citations);
      
      // Create a custom response object with citations
      const customResponse = {
        ...response,
        output: [
          {
            type: "message",
            id: response.output[0].id,
            status: "completed",
            role: "assistant",
            content: [
              {
                type: "output_text",
                text: formattedResponse.text,
                annotations: formattedResponse.annotations
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        output_text: formattedResponse.text
      };
      
      // Replace the original response with our custom one
      response = customResponse;
    }
  }
  console.log('Final Answer:\n', response.output_text);
  console.log('Annotations:', JSON.stringify(response.output[0]?.content[0]?.annotations || [], null, 2));
  console.log('Response with Citations:', JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
  
  return response;
}

// Helper function to format response with citations
function formatResponseWithCitations(text, citations) {
  // Create empty annotations array
  const annotations = [];
  let formattedText = text;
  
  // For each citation, append a numbered reference to the text
  citations.forEach((citation, index) => {
    // Create annotation object
    const annotation = {
      type: "url_citation",
      start_index: formattedText.length,
      end_index: formattedText.length + citation.url.length + 3, // +3 for '[', ']' and space
      url: citation.url,
      title: citation.title
    };
    
    // Add annotation to the array
    annotations.push(annotation);
    
    // Append citation to text
    formattedText += `\n\n[${index + 1}] ${citation.url}`;
  });
  
  return { 
    text: formattedText, 
    annotations 
  };
}

// Example of how to use with a dynamic query
// For Node.js environments, you can use readline or process.argv
// For browser environments, you can use this function with user input from a form
// This is just a simple example:

async function runExaSearchExample() {
  const userQuery = process.argv[2] || "What's the latest news about AI?";
  const result = await run_exa_search(userQuery);
  return result;
}

// Run the function if directly executed
if (require.main === module) {
  runExaSearchExample().catch(console.error);
}

// Export the function for use in other modules
module.exports = { run_exa_search };
```

Both examples show how to:

1. Set up the OpenAI Response API with Exa as a tool
2. Make a request to OpenAI
3. Handle the search function call
4. Send the search results back to OpenAI
5. Get the final response

Remember to replace the empty API key strings with your actual API keys when trying these examples.

## How Tool Calling Works

Let's break down how the Exa web search tool works with OpenAI's Response API:

1. **Tool Definition**: First, we define our Exa search as a tool that OpenAI can use:
   ```javascript
   {
     "type": "function",
     "name": "exa_websearch",
     "description": "Search the web using Exa...",
     "parameters": {
       "query": "string"  // The search query parameter
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Initial Request**: When you send a message to OpenAI, the API looks at your message and decides if it needs to search the web. If it does, instead of giving a direct answer, it will return a "function call" in its output.

3. **Function Call**: If OpenAI decides to search, it returns something like:
   ```javascript
   {
     "type": "function_call",
     "name": "exa_websearch",
     "arguments": { "query": "your search query" }
   }
   ```

4. **Search Execution**: Your code then:
   * Takes this search query
   * Calls Exa's API to perform the actual web search
   * Gets real web results back

5. **Final Response**: You send these web results back to OpenAI, and it gives you a final answer using the fresh information from the web.

This back-and-forth process happens automatically in the code above, letting OpenAI use Exa's web search when it needs to find current information.

While there are abundant AI models available for different domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional ability in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic interface to empower t",

## Create a .env file

Create a file called `.env` in the root of your project and add the following line.

```bash
EXA_API_KEY=your api key without quotes
```

<br />

## Make an API request

Use our python or javascript SDKs, or call the API directly with cURL.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    Install the python SDKs with pip.  If you want to store your API key in a `.env` file, make sure to install the dotenv library.

    ```bash

# RAG with Exa and OpenAI
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/rag-quickstart

Learn how to build your first Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system with Exa and OpenAI. 

***

By combining Exa's search capabilities with OpenAI's language models, you can build a system that retrieves relevant, up-to-date information and generates insightful summaries. Here is the workflow:

**1. Retrieval (Exa):** Searches the web to find relevant and up-to-date results based on your query.

**2. Processing:** Combines the retrieved Exa search results with your LLM query.

**3. Generation (OpenAI):** Uses OpenAI's LLM to generate an informed response using both your query and Exa's search results.

***

## Get Started

First, create an account and grab a free API key.

<Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

Next, choose to use our Python or TypeScript SDK to set up your RAG system.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the python SDK">
        ```Shell Shell
        pip install exa_py
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Instantiate the client">
        ```Python Python
        exa = Exa('EXA_API_KEY') # Replace EXA_API_KEY with your actual API key
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make a search using the search_and_contents method">
        The `search_and_contents` method returns a list of search results with the contents and/or highlights of the webpages.
        <Note> You can find a more detailed explanation of the methods [here](/exa-s-capabilities-explained). </Note>

        ```Python Python
        result = exa.search_and_contents(
          "hottest AI startups",
          text=True
        )

        print(result)

      <Step title="Set up OpenAI to perform RAG">
        Create a RAG system by setting up the OpenAI client to summarize the Exa search results.

        <Note> Make sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key in the `.env` file. </Note>

        ```Python Python
        # Install OpenAI library
        !pip install openai

        # Import and set up OpenAI client
        from openai import OpenAI
        import os

        client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Call the OpenAI client">
        Now, call the OpenAI client, passing:

        1. A system prompt that defines the AI's role.
        2. A user message that describes the task you want the AI to perform.

        ```Python Python
        system_prompt = "You are a helpful AI assistant. Summarize the given search results about AI startups."
        user_message = "Please provide a brief summary of the top AI startups based on the search results."

        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Search results: {result}\n\n{user_message}"}
            ]
        )

        print(response.choices[0].message.content)
        ```

# Exa LiveCrawl
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/should-we-use-livecrawl



***

With Exa, we can already search the web using LLMs.

However, by default, we cache all of our links to bias for the fastest response possible. You may be interested in the live version of the page, which our `livecrawl` parameter can help with.

## Using LiveCrawl

LiveCrawl becomes essential when you need the most up-to-date contents from a URL. Here are some examples:

1. **Company News**: If you're tracking Apple's latest releases, you may be looking for a live view of their homepage's contentes:

```Python Python
result = exa.get_contents(
  ["https://www.apple.com"],
  livecrawl="always"
)
```

Output without LiveCrawl: Results here are slightly dated, mentioning a fall release (later in the year)

2. **Product Launches**: Tracking new releases or price changes
3. **Event Coverage**: Live events like conferences or sports
4. **Social Media Trends**: To stay updated on the latest trends or viral content

`livecrawl:'always'` ensures you're working with the freshest data available, though it may take slightly longer than using cached results.

`livecrawl:'never'` means that you will always get cached results.

`livecrawl:'fallback'` means that Exa will livecrawl results if its not available in cache (for keyword search).

`livecrawl:'auto'` means that Exa will decide whether to use livecrawl or not based on the query.

## When LiveCrawl Isn't Necessary

Cached data is sufficient for many queries, especially for historical topics like "What were the major causes of World War II?" or educational content such as "How does photosynthesis work?" These subjects rarely change, so reliable cached results can provide accurate information quickly.

# Tool calling with Claude
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/tool-calling-with-claude

Using Claude's "Tool Use" Feature with Exa Search Integration.

***

This guide will show you how to properly set up and use Anthropic's and Exa's API client, and utilise Claude's function calling or "tool use" feature to perform Exa search integration. Here are the steps:

1. Install the prerequisite packages and set up API keys as environment variables
2. Understand how Claude's "tool use" feature works
3. Use Exa within the tool use feature

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites and installation">
    Before you can use this guide you will need to have [python3](https://www.python.org/doc/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed on your machine.

    For the purpose of this guide we will need to install:

    * `anthropic` library to perform Claude API calls and completions
    * `exa_py` library to perform Exa search
    * `rich` library to make the output more readable

    Install the libraries.

    ```python Python
    pip install anthropic exa_py rich
    ```

    To successfully use the Exa search client and Anthropic client you will need to have your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `EXA_API_KEY`\
    set as environment variables.

    To get an Anthropic API key, you will first need an Anthropic account, visit the [Anthropic console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) to generate your API key.

    Similarly, to get the Exa API key, you will first need an Exa account, visit the Exa dashboard to generate your API key.

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

    > Be safe with your API keys. Make sure they are not hardcoded in your code or added to a git repository to prevent leaking them to the public.

    You can create an `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following to it:

    ```bash Bash
    API_KEY=insert your Anthropic API key here, without the quotes
    EXA_API_KEY=insert your Exa API key here, without the quotes
    ```

    Make sure to add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file if you have one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding Claude's Tool Use Feature">
    Claude LLMs can call a function you have defined in your code; this is called [tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use). To do this, you first need to describe the function you want to call to Claude's LLM. You can do this by defining a description object of the format:

    ```json JSON
    {
        "name": "my_function_name", # The name of the function
        "description": "The description of my function", # Describe the function so Claude knows when and how to use it.
        "input_schema": { # input schema describes the format and the type of parameters Claude needs to generate to use the function
            "type": "object", # format of the generated Claude response
            "properties": { # properties defines the input parameters of the function
                "query": { # the function expects a query parameter
                    "description": "The search query to perform.", # describes the parameter to Claude
                },
            },
            "required": ["query"], # define which parameters are required
        },
    }
    ```

    When this description is sent to Claude's LLM, it returns an object with a string, which is the function name defined in *your* code, and the arguments that the function takes. This does not execute or *call* functions on Anthropic's side; it only returns the function name and arguments which you will have to parse and call yourself in your code.

    ```python Python
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835123",
      "name": "my_function_name",
      "input": {"query": "Latest developments in quantum computing"}
    }
    ```

    We will use the object of this format to call the `exa_search` function we define.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Exa Search as Claude tool">
    First, we import and initialise the Anthropic and Exa libraries and load the stored API keys.

    ```python Python
    import anthropic

    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from exa_py import Exa

    load_dotenv()

    claude = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))
    exa = Exa(api_key=os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"))
    ```

    Next, we define the function and the function schema so that Claude knows how to use it and what arguments our local function takes:

    ```python Python
    TOOLS = [
        {
            "name": "exa_search",
            "description": "Perform a search query on the web, and retrieve the most relevant URLs/web data.",
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The search query to perform.",
                    },
                },
                "required": ["query"],
            },
        }
    ]
    ```

    Finally, we'll define the primer `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, which explains to Claude what it is supposed to do:

    ```python Python
    SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "You are an agent that has access to an advanced search engine. Please provide the user with the information they are looking for by using the search tool provided."
    ```

    We can now start writing the code needed to perform the LLM calls and the search. We'll create the `exa_search` function that will call Exa's `search_and_contents` function with the query:

    ```python Python
    def exa_search(query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return exa.search_and_contents(query=query, type='auto', highlights=True)
    ```

    Next, we create a function to process the tool use:

    ```python Python
    def process_tool_calls(tool_calls):
        search_results = []
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            function_name = tool_call.name
            function_args = tool_call.input
            if function_name == "exa_search":
                results = exa_search(**function_args)
                search_results.append(results)
                console.print(
                    f"[bold cyan]Context updated[/bold cyan] [i]with[/i] "
                    f"[bold green]exa_search[/bold green]: ",
                    function_args.get("query"),
                )
        return search_results
    ```

    Lastly, we'll create a `main` function to bring it all together, and handle the user input and interaction with Claude:

    ```python Python
    def main():
        messages = []

                )
                messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_query})

                )
                message = completion.content[0]
                tool_calls = [content for content in completion.content if content.type == "tool_use"]
                if tool_calls:
                    search_results = process_tool_calls(tool_calls)
                    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": f"I've performed a search and found the following results: {search_results}"})
                    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Please summarise this information and answer my previous query based on these results."})
                    completion = claude.messages.create(
                        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
                        max_tokens=1024,
                        system=SYSTEM_MESSAGE,
                        messages=messages,
                    )
                    response = completion.content[0].text
                    console.print(Markdown(response))
                    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
                else:
                    console.print(Markdown(message.text))
                    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": message.text})

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    The implementation creates a loop that continually prompts the user for search queries, uses Claude's tool use feature to determine when to perform a search, and then uses the Exa search results to provide an informed response to the user's query.

    We also use the rich library to provide a more visually appealing console interface, including coloured output and markdown rendering for the responses.

    We have now written an advanced search tool that combines the power of Claude's language models with Exa's semantic search capabilities, providing users with informative and context-aware responses to their queries.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running the code">
    Save the code in a file, e.g. `claude_search.py`, and make sure the `.env` file containing the API keys we previously created is in the same directory as the script.

    Then run the script using the following command from your terminal:

    ```bash Bash
    python claude_search.py
    ```

    You should see a prompt:

    ```bash Bash
    What do you want to search for?
    ```

    Let's test it out.

    ```bash Bash
    What do you want to search for?: Who is Steve Rogers?
    Context updated with exa_search:  Steve Rogers
    Based on the search results, Steve Rogers is a fictional superhero character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is better known as Captain America.

    The key points about Steve Rogers are:

     • He was born in the 1920s to a poor family in New York City. As a frail young man, he was rejected from military service during World War II.
     • He was recruited into a secret government program called Project Rebirth where he was transformed into a super-soldier through an experimental serum, gaining enhanced strength, agility and other abilities.
     • After the serum treatment, he became Captain America and fought against the Nazis alongside other heroes like Bucky Barnes and the Invaders during WWII.
     • He was frozen in ice towards the end of the war and remained that way for decades until being revived in modern times.
     • As Captain America, he continued his heroic adventures, becoming a core member and leader of the superhero team the Avengers.
     • Steve Rogers embodies the ideals of patriotism, freedom and serving one's country as a symbol of liberty and justice.

    So in summary, Steve Rogers is the original and most well-known character to take on the superhero mantle of Captain America within the Marvel universe.
    ```

    That's it, enjoy your search agent!

# Tool calling with GPT
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/reference/tool-calling-with-gpt4o

Learn to use OpenAI's tool call feature with Exa's Search Integration

***

OpenAI's [tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?lang=python) allows LLMs to call functions that are defined in your code. This guide will show you how to utilise "tool calling" to call Exa's search, with the following steps:

1. Install prerequisite packages and set up the environment
2. Overview of how OpenAI's tool calling feature works
3. Use Exa within an OpenAI tool call

***

## Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-requisites and installation">
    Install the:

    * `openai` library to perform OpenAI API calls and completions
    * `exa_py` library to perform Exa search
    * `rich` library to make the output more readable

    ```python Python
    pip install openai exa_py rich
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up the environment variables">
    Create an `.env` file in the root of your project and set the `EXA_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API keys respectively. Visit the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and the [Exa dashboard](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys) to generate your API keys.

    <br />

    <Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

    ```Shell Shell
    OPENAI_API_KEY=insert your Exa API key here, without quotes
    EXA_API_KEY=insert your Exa API key here, without quotes
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="What is OpenAI tool calling?">
    OpenAI LLMs can call a function you have defined in your code, this is called [tool calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?lang=python). To do this you first need to describe the function you want to call to OpenAI's LLM. You can do this by defining a description object of the format:

    ```json JSON
    {
        "name": "my_function_name", # The name of the function
        "description": "The description of my function", # Describe the function so OpenAI knows when and how to use it.
        "input_schema": { # input schema describes the format and the type of parameters OpenAI needs to generate to use the function
            "type": "object", # format of the generated OpenAI response
            "properties": { # properties defines the input parameters of the function
                "query": { # the function expects a query parameter
                    "type": "string", # of type string
                    "description": "The search query to perform.", # describes the paramteres to OpenAI
                },
            },
            "required": ["query"], # define which parameters are required
        },
    }
    ```

    When this description is sent to OpenAI's LLM, it returns an object with a string, which is the function name defined in *your* code, and the arguments that the function takes. This does not execute or *call* functions on OpenAI's side; it only returns the function name and arguments which you will have to parse and call yourself in your code.

    ```python Python
    ...
    id='call_62136123',
    function=Function(
        arguments='{"query":"Latest developments in quantum computing"}',
        name='exa_search',),
    type='function'
    ...
    ```

    We will use this object to - in this case - call the `exa_search` function we define with the arguments provided.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Exa Search as an OpenAI tool">
    First, we import and initialise the OpenAI and Exa libraries and load the stored API keys.

    ```python Python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from exa_py import Exa
    from openai import OpenAI

    load_dotenv()

    openai = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    exa = Exa(api_key=os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"))
    ```

    Next, we define the function and the function schema so that OpenAI knows how to use it and what arguments our local function takes:

    ```python Python
    TOOLS = [
        {
            "name": "exa_search",
            "description": "Perform a search query on the web, and retrieve the most relevant URLs/web data.",
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The search query to perform.",
                    },
                },
                "required": ["query"],
            },
        }
    ]
    ```

    Finally, we'll define the primer `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, which explains to OpenAI what it is supposed to do:

    ```python Python
    SYSTEM_MESSAGE = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are an agent that has access to an advanced search engine. Please provide the user with the information they are looking for by using the search tool provided.",
    }
    ```

    We can now start writing the code needed to perform the LLM calls and the search. We'll create the `exa_search` function that will call Exa's `search_and_contents` function with the query:

    ```python Python
    def exa_search(query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return exa.search_and_contents(query=query, type='auto', highlights=True)
    ```

    Next, we create a function to process the tool calls:

    ```python Python
    def process_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages):
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            function_name = tool_call.function.name
            function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
            if function_name == "exa_search":
                search_results = exa_search(**function_args)
                messages.append(
                    {
                        "role": "tool",
                        "content": str(search_results),
                        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
                    }
                )
                console.print(
                    f"[bold cyan]Context updated[/bold cyan] [i]with[/i] "
                    f"[bold green]exa_search ({function_args.get('mode')})[/bold green]: ",
                    function_args.get("query"),
                )
        return messages
    ```

    Lastly, we'll create a `main` function to bring it all together, and handle the user input and interaction with OpenAI:

    ```python Python
    def main():
        messages = [SYSTEM_MESSAGE]
        while True:
            try:
                user_query = Prompt.ask(
                    "[bold yellow]What do you want to search for?[/bold yellow]",
                )
                messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_query})
                completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
                    model="gpt-4o-mini",
                    messages=messages,
                    tools=TOOLS,
                )
                message = completion.choices[0].message
                tool_calls = message.tool_calls
                if tool_calls:
                    messages.append(message)
                    messages = process_tool_calls(tool_calls, messages)
                    messages.append(
                        {
                            "role": "user",
                            "content": "Answer my previous query based on the search results.",
                        }
                    )
                    completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
                        model="gpt-4o-mini",
                        messages=messages,
                    )
                    console.print(Markdown(completion.choices[0].message.content))
                else:
                    console.print(Markdown(message.content))
            except Exception as e:
                console.print(f"[bold red]An error occurred:[/bold red] {str(e)}")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    The implementation creates a loop that continually prompts the user for search queries, uses OpenAI's tool calling feature to determine when to perform a search, and then uses the Exa search results to provide an informed response to the user's query.

    We also use the rich library to provide a more visually appealing console interface, including coloured output and markdown rendering for the responses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running the code">
    Save the code in a file, e.g. `openai_search.py`, and make sure the `.env` file containing the API keys we previously created is in the same directory as the script.

    Then run the script using the following command from your terminal:

    ```bash Bash
    python openai_search.py
    ```

    You should see a prompt:

    ```bash Bash
    What do you want to search for?
    ```

    Let's test it out.

    ```bash Bash
    What do you want to search for?: Who is Tony Stark?
    Context updated with exa_search (None):  Tony Stark
    Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, is a fictional superhero from Marvel Comics. He is a wealthy inventor and businessman, known for creating a powered suit of armor that gives him superhuman abilities. Tony Stark is a founding member of the Avengers and has appeared in various comic book series, animated
    television shows, and films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

    That's it, enjoy your search agent!

### Returns:

The return type depends on the combination of `text` and `highlights` parameters:

* `SearchResponse[ResultWithText]`: When only `text` is provided or when neither `text` nor `highlights` is provided (defaults to including text).
* `SearchResponse[ResultWithHighlights]`: When only `highlights` is provided.
* `SearchResponse[ResultWithTextAndHighlights]`: When both `text` and `highlights` are provided.

The response contains similar results and an optional autoprompt string.

Note: If neither `text` nor `highlights` is specified, the method defaults to including the full text content.

## `answer` Method

Generate an answer to a query using Exa's search and LLM capabilities. This method returns an AnswerResponse with the answer and a list of citations. You can optionally retrieve the full text of each citation by setting text=True.

### Input Example:

```Python Python
response = exa.answer("What is the capital of France?")

print(response.answer)       # e.g. "Paris"
print(response.citations)    # list of citations used

# If you want the full text of the citations in the response:
response_with_text = exa.answer(
    "What is the capital of France?",
    text=True
)
print(response_with_text.citations[0].text)  # Full page text
```

### Input Parameters:

| Parameter | Type            | Description                                                                              | Default  |

## `stream_answer` Method

Generate a streaming answer to a query with Exa's LLM capabilities. Instead of returning a single response, this method yields chunks of text and/or citations as they become available.

### Input Example:

```Python Python
stream = exa.stream_answer("What is the capital of France?", text=True)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.content:
        print("Partial answer:", chunk.content)

        for citation in chunk.citations:
            print("Citation found:", citation.url)
```

### Input Parameters:

| Parameter | Type            | Description                                                            | Default  |

| query     | str             | The question to answer.                                                | Required |
| text      | Optional\[bool] | If true, includes full text of each citation in the streamed response. | False    |

### Return Type:

A `StreamAnswerResponse` object, which is iterable. Iterating over it yields `StreamChunk` objects:

### `StreamChunk`

| Field     | Type                           | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| content   | Optional\[str]                 | Partial text content of the answer so far.  |
| citations | Optional\[List\[AnswerResult]] | Citations discovered in this chunk, if any. |

Use `stream.close()` to end the streaming session if needed.

# Get an Event
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/events/get-an-event

get /v0/events/{id}
Get a single Event by id.

You can subscribe to Events by creating a Webhook.



# List all Events
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/events/list-all-events

get /v0/events
List all events that have occurred in the system.

You can paginate through the results using the `cursor` parameter.



# Event Types
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/events/types

Learn about the events that occur within the Webset API

The Websets API uses events to notify you about changes in your Websets. You can monitor these events through our [events endpoint](/websets/api/events/list-all-events) or by setting up [webhooks](/websets/api/webhooks/create-a-webhook).

## Webset

* `webset.created` - Emitted when a new Webset is created.
* `webset.deleted` - Emitted when a Webset is deleted.
* `webset.paused` - Emitted when a Webset's operations are paused.
* `webset.idle` - Emitted when a Webset has no running operations.

## Search

* `webset.search.created` - Emitted when a new search is initiated.
* `webset.search.updated` - Emitted when search progress is updated.
* `webset.search.completed` - Emitted when a search finishes finding all items.
* `webset.search.canceled` - Emitted when a search is manually canceled.

## Item

* `webset.item.created` - Emitted when a new item has been added to the Webset.
* `webset.item.enriched` - Emitted when an item's enrichment is completed.

## Export

* `webset.export.created` - Emitted when a new export is initiated.
* `webset.export.completed` - Emitted when an export is ready for download.

Each event includes:

* A unique `id`
* The event `type`
* A `data` object containing the full resource that triggered the event
* A `createdAt` timestamp

You can use these events to:

* Track the progress of searches and enrichments
* Build real-time dashboards
* Trigger workflows when new items are found
* Monitor the status of your exports

  <Tab title="Python">
    Install the latest version of the python SDK with pip. If you want to store your API key in a `.env` file, make sure to install the dotenv library.

    ```bash
    pip install exa-py
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

    Create a file called `webset.py` and add the code below:

    ```python python
    from exa_py import Exa
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    from exa_py.websets.types import CreateWebsetParameters, CreateEnrichmentParameters

    import os

    load_dotenv()
    exa = Exa(os.getenv('EXA_API_KEY'))

    # Create a Webset with search and enrichments
    webset = exa.websets.create(
        params=CreateWebsetParameters(
            search={
                "query": "Top AI research labs focusing on large language models",

                    format="text",
                ),
            ],
        )
    )

    print(f"Webset created with ID: {webset.id}")

    # Wait until Webset completes processing
    webset = exa.websets.wait_until_idle(webset.id)

    # Retrieve Webset Items
    items = exa.websets.items.list(webset_id=webset.id)
    for item in items.data:
        print(f"Item: {item.model_dump_json(indent=2)}")
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    Install the latest version of the JavaScript SDK with npm or pnpm:

    ```bash
    npm install exa-js
    ```

    Create a file called `webset.js` and add the code below:

    ```javascript javascript
    import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
    import Exa, { CreateWebsetParameters, CreateEnrichmentParameters } from "exa-js";

    // Load environment variables
    dotenv.config();

    async function main() {
      const exa = new Exa(process.env.EXA_API_KEY);

      try {

          },
          enrichments: [
            {
              description: "Estimate the company'\''s founding year",
              format: "number"
            }
          ],
        });

        console.log(`Webset created with ID: ${webset.id}`);

        // Wait until Webset completes processing
        const idleWebset = await exa.websets.waitUntilIdle(webset.id, {
          timeout: 60000,
          pollInterval: 2000,
          onPoll: (status) => console.log(`Current status: ${status}...`)
        });

        // Retrieve Webset Items
        const items = await exa.websets.items.list(webset.id, { limit: 10 });
        for (const item of items.data) {
          console.log(`Item: ${JSON.stringify(item, null, 2)}`);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error);
      }
    }

    main();
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="cURL">
    Pass the following command to your terminal to create a Webset:

    ```bash bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.exa.ai/websets/v0/websets/ \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \

            "format": "number"
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```

    To check the status of your Webset:

    ```bash bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.exa.ai/websets/v0/websets/{WEBSET_ID} \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header "x-api-key: ${EXA_API_KEY}"
    ```

    To list items in your Webset:

    ```bash bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.exa.ai/websets/v0/websets/{WEBSET_ID}/items \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header "x-api-key: ${EXA_API_KEY}"
    ```

    Or you can use the `expand` parameter to get the latest 100 within your Webset:

    ```bash bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.exa.ai/websets/v0/websets/{WEBSET_ID}?expand=items \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \

# How It Works
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/how-it-works



The Websets API operates as an **asynchronous search system**. When you create a Webset, it automatically starts searching and verifying results based on your criteria. Let's dive into each part of the process.

***

## Creating Your First Search

The process starts when you [create a Webset](/websets/api/create-a-webset). Here's how it flows:

### 1. Initial Request

Start by providing a search configuration:

```json
{
  "search": {
    "query": "AI companies in Europe that raised Series A funding",
    "count": 50
  }
}
```

You can optionally specify:

* An `entity.type` to define what you're looking for
* Custom `criteria` for verification
* `enrichments` to extract specific data points
* `metadata` for your own tracking

### 2. Webset Creation

When your request is received:

1. A new Webset is created with status `running`
2. A `webset.created` event is emitted
3. The search process begins automatically

### 3. Search Process

The search flows through several stages:

1. **Initialization**

   * A new WebsetSearch is created
   * Status is set to `running`
   * `webset.search.created` event is emitted

2. **Discovery & Verification**

   * The system starts retrieving results leveraging Exa Search and verifies each one
   * Items that pass verification and match your search criteria are automatically added to your Webset
   * Each new item triggers a `webset.item.created` event
   * Items are immediately available through the [list endpoint](/websets/api/list-all-items-for-a-webset)

3. **Enrichment** (if configured)

   * Each item is processed through specified enrichments
   * `webset.item.enriched` events are emitted as results come in
   * Enrichment results are added to the item's data

4. **Completion**
   * When the search finds all items, its status changes to `completed`
   * A `webset.search.completed` event is emitted
   * If no other operations are running, you'll receive a `webset.idle` event

### Accessing Results

You can access your data throughout the process:

1. **Real-time Access**

   * Use the list endpoint to paginate through items
   * Listen for item events (`webset.item.created` and `webset.item.enriched`) to process results as they arrive

2. **Bulk Export**
   * Available once the Webset becomes `idle`
   * Includes all items with their content, verifications and enrichments
   * Useful for processing the complete dataset

***

## Running Additional Searches

You can [create additional searches](/websets/api/create-a-search) on the same Webset at any time. Each new search:

* Follows the same event flow as the initial search
* Can run in parallel with other enrichment operations (not other searches for now)
* Maintains its own progress tracking
* Contributes to the overall Webset state

### Control Operations

Manage your searches with:

* [Cancel specific searches](/websets/api/cancel-a-running-search)
* [Cancel all operations](/websets/api/cancel-a-running-webset)


# Overview
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/websets/api/overview

The Websets API helps you find, verify, and process web data at scale to build your unique collection of web content.

The Websets API helps you create your own unique slice of the web by organizing content in containers (`Webset`). These containers store structured results (`WebsetItem`) which are discovered by search agents (`WebsetSearch`) that find web pages matching your specific criteria. Once these items are added to your Webset, they can be further processed with enrichment agents to extract additional data.

Whether you're looking for companies, people, or research papers, each result becomes a structured Item with source content, verification status, and type-specific fields. These Items can be further enriched with enrichments.

## Key Features

At its core, the API is:

* **Asynchronous**: It's an async-first API. Searches (`Webset Search`) can take from seconds to minutes, depending on the complexity.

* **Structured**: Every result (`Webset Item`) includes structured properties, webpage content, and verification against your criteria, with reasoning and references explaining why it matches.

* **Event-Driven**: Events are published and delivered through webhooks to notify when items are found and when enrichments complete, allowing you to process data as it arrives.

***

## Core Objects

<img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/websets/api/core.png" alt="Core concepts diagram showing relationships between Webset, Search, Item and Enrichment objects" />

* **Webset**: Container that organizes your unique collection of web content and its related searches
* **Search**: An agent that searches and crawls the web to find precise entities matching your criteria, adding them to your Webset as structured WebsetItems
* **Item**: A structured result with source content, verification status, and type-specific fields (company, person, research paper, etc.)
* **Enrichment**: An agent that searches the web to enhance existing WebsetItems with additional structured data

Here's how to prompt your query in Websets

Websets is a web research agent designed to find a perfect list of results that matches your criteria. Here's how to prompt it:

<Note>
  **How not to prompt Websets:** Websets is not an answer engine, so it's not meant for queries like "How your I think about xyz" or "Give me a report on abc".&#x20;
</Note>

* Type in your query, thinking of the type of thing you're trying to find (e.g. Companies, People, Research Papers, Articles, Reports, etc.)&#x20;

* Describing in detail the type of results you'd like. Common descriptors include location, size, theme, industry, qualifiers (e.g. have ISO certification, know rust), past experience etc.

# FAQ
Source: https://docs.exa.ai/websets/faq

Frequently asked questions about Websets

***

<Accordion title="Who is Websets for?">
  Websets is a tool meant to solve sourcing for knowledge workers. Here are a
  few major use cases: Recruiters: source potential candidates for any role (we
  all know Linkedin search is broken after all) Sales teams: source companies
  and points of contact that match your ICP. Watch hours of outbound research be
  done in minutes Investors: whether you're looking for your next target or
  doing diligence, Websets can be a powerful tool. Find companies, financial
  statements, reports and news. Researchers: find research papers, reports, news
  and more. No matter what you're researching. Founder: find competitors, tweet
  ideas, candidates, potential customers, potential investors and more. And
  more! We've seen thousands of different use cases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What exactly does Websets do?">
  Websets helps you find lists of entities (e.g. companies, people, research
  papers) that match the specific criteria you provide. It's not an all-purpose
  Q\&A engine, so stick to queries aimed at listing out or filtering by certain
  attributes. Websets can find people, companies, financial reports, research
  papers, articles, news, blogposts, tweets, reddit threads, Github repos, the
  list goes on.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I not getting any results?">
  Too many restrictive criteria. If your search is very narrow (e.g., "Companies
  in Antarctica that raised \$1B in seed funding in 2025"), it may be impossible
  to find matches. You can try removing or broadening certain criteria and
  searching again. Asking questions not meant for Websets (e.g. if you're asking
  open ended questions such as "How's the European economy doing in 2025?" or
  specific questions such as "What's an EGOT?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many results can I request in one webset?">
  You can request anywhere from 1 to 1000+ results (depending on your plan and
  credit balance). However: Large requests (1000+ results) can take about an
  hour or more to complete. Websets stops automatically if it can't find your
  requested number of matching items before hitting its search limit (50× your
  requested size or 50,000 max).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I remove or tweak results?">
  Yes. On the results page, you can manually delete any entries that you don't
  want to keep. If you see that the results aren't what you need, you can also
  refine your criteria and try again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do credits and pricing work?">
  Free: 5 websets up to 10 results, with limited features

  Subscription Core plan: \$200/month - 20,000 credits per month

  Pro plan: \$800/month - 100,000 credits per month

  10 credit = 1 all-green result in a generated webset. For example, if you generate a webset of 50 perfect matches, that uses 500 credits. Credits are also used for special features such as custom columns, requesting emails/contact information & alerts.

  Topping up credits: If you run out, you can contact your point person to purchase additional credits manually.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my Webset taking a long time?">
  Large requests (especially 1000+ results) can take up to \~1 hour. This is
  normal because Websets scans a large volume of data. The more criteria, the
  tougher it is to find those results. These types of searches are narrower and
  can take longer as well You can monitor the progress in the left-hand panel,
  where you'll see the job's status and any partial progress.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where does Websets get its data?">
  Websets runs using the Exa API - a powerful search engine that combines
  keyword and semantic search methods to find precise criteria. Websets collects
  and aggregates data from publicly available sources (e.g., company websites,
  press releases). It can validate different criteria using different data
  sources. This ensures that we can find more matches, more accurately. The tool
  surfaces the references (links) used, so you can check exactly which sources
  informed each match.10
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my criteria after I've generated a full webset?">
  Absolutely. You can revise your original query or tweak the criteria from the
  Search More button on the lower left hand side. You would then run a new
  Webset which would consume new credits based on how many all-green results you
  generate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I still have more questions or need more credits?">
  Contact your account representative or point person if you need help,
  additional credits, or have feedback about your results, or [hello@exa.ai](mailto:hello@exa.ai).
</Accordion>
